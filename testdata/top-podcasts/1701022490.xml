      <title>Man Utd’s Muddled Strategy, Favourite European Nights &amp; Gary’s Celebrity Big Brother Offer</title>
      <description>What exactly is Man Utd’s strategy for getting back to the top? Which are the European nights that live long in the memory for our trio? After Gary turned down the chance to go on Celebrity Big Brother, are there any reality shows the guys would do?

Gary, Alan and Micah also debate whether we’ll ever see another player like Steve Bull, who played for England whilst not playing in the top flight of domestic football.

Plus, did Micah wear short-sleeve shirts just to flex his biceps? 

The lads attempt to solve the dilemma of whether long-sleeve or short-sleeve shirts are better with the help of Gemini Live on Google Pixel 9. Are you team short-sleeve or long-sleeve when playing?

      <title>David Ornstein: Deadline Day Deals, Toney &amp; Guéhi Transfer Sagas &amp; Caddying For Alan Shearer</title>
