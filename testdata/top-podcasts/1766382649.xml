      <title>TALK TRACKS EP: 2 Exploring Animal Telepathy with Ditte Young</title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com</link>
      <description>In this episode of The Talk Tracks, we dive into the fascinating world of animal telepathy with renowned communicator Ditte Young, whose work has transformed the relationships between top equestrians and their horses. Joining us are Ellen Birgitte “EB” Farbrot, a Norwegian dressage rider who has competed in two World Championships and qualified for two Olympic Games, and Amalie König, a Danish national showjumping team rider with multiple championship wins. Both athletes share remarkable experiences of how Ditte’s telepathic insights have helped them overcome challenges with their horses—ranging from debilitating performance blocks to deeply personal health revelations that their animals seemed to sense before they did.

But Ditte’s abilities aren’t just reserved for elite riders and their championship horses. In this episode, Ky also enlists Ditte’s help to connect with her family’s rescue dog, Tucker, a senior pup with a tragic past who has struggled to trust and connect since being adopted. What unfolds is an astonishing session that reveals details Ditte couldn’t possibly have known—shedding light on Tucker’s inner world and offering a pathway to healing. Whether you’re a skeptic or a believer, this episode explores the profound and often overlooked bonds we share with the animals in our lives and asks: Could telepathy be real, and if so, what does it mean for our understanding of connection itself?

      <title>Ep 10:  In Their Words: Messages from the Non-Speakers</title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In this powerful and transformative finale, The Telepathy Tapes cedes the floor entirely to the non-speakers. For the first time, their voices take center stage as they share their unfiltered truths, hopes, and profound wisdom. Through their own words, the non-speakers reveal how they experience the world, the changes they dream of, and the urgent message they have for humanity.

Themes of this episode include the need for inclusion and respect, the call for society to presume competence, and a vision of a more compassionate, interconnected world. From education reform and advocacy for spelling-based communication methods to the role of emotions, love, and spiritual awakening in human evolution, their insights are both deeply personal and universally resonant.

With heartfelt candor and extraordinary perspective, the non-speakers challenge us to act—transforming awareness into meaningful change. This episode is not only a call to understand but also a call to action.

      <title>Ep. 9: Telepathy Across Dimensions, Death, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In this episode of The Telepathy Tapes, we venture into uncharted territory, exploring telepathy’s potential to transcend not only distance but dimensions. Through two remarkable stories, we examine the profound interconnectedness that ties us all together and consider how nonspeaking individuals may access realities beyond our comprehension.

We begin with Tahni, a mother whose son Josiah’s first independent sentence—“God is a good gift giver”—opened a door to extraordinary spiritual insights. Josiah, a nonspeaker, shares detailed knowledge of people and places he’s never encountered, leading his family into a transformative journey of faith and discovery. Tahni recounts how Josiah’s prophetic messages, poetic writings, and profound spiritual understanding challenged their perception of reality and reshaped their lives.

We then turn to John Paul, a non-speaker from Atlanta whose tragic passing unveiled a web of mysterious connections. His loved ones, including his mother Libby and girlfriend Lily, recount powerful spiritual experiences surrounding his death, from premonitions to vivid messages delivered through other non-speakers. John Paul’s story highlights the shared belief among non-speakers that they connect to realms beyond the physical world, including a place known as “the hill,” a spiritual gathering point where they interact with others.

The episode explores themes of prophetic visions, the eternal nature of consciousness, and the paradigm-shifting idea that non-speakers may tap into knowledge and dimensions inaccessible to most. Through the lens of Josiah’s prophetic writings, John Paul’s heavenly journey, and insights from other non-speakers, we confront the possibility that our understanding of reality is fundamentally incomplete.

This profound exploration leaves us with a challenging yet hopeful message: the boundaries of reality may be far more flexible than we think, and the wisdom of non-speakers offers us a glimpse into a deeper, more interconnected existence. Prepare for a journey that will expand your mind and challenge your beliefs, as we push the limits of telepathy and reality itself

      <itunes:subtitle>Exploring telepathy’s ability to transcend dimensions and death and what that reveals about the fabric of our reality</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode of The Telepathy Tapes, we venture into uncharted territory, exploring telepathy’s potential to transcend not only distance but dimensions. Through two remarkable stories, we examine the profound interconnectedness that ties us all together and consider how nonspeaking individuals may access realities beyond our comprehension.

We begin with Tahni, a mother whose son Josiah’s first independent sentence—“God is a good gift giver”—opened a door to extraordinary spiritual insights. Josiah, a nonspeaker, shares detailed knowledge of people and places he’s never encountered, leading his family into a transformative journey of faith and discovery. Tahni recounts how Josiah’s prophetic messages, poetic writings, and profound spiritual understanding challenged their perception of reality and reshaped their lives.

We then turn to John Paul, a non-speaker from Atlanta whose tragic passing unveiled a web of mysterious connections. His loved ones, including his mother Libby and girlfriend Lily, recount powerful spiritual experiences surrounding his death, from premonitions to vivid messages delivered through other non-speakers. John Paul’s story highlights the shared belief among non-speakers that they connect to realms beyond the physical world, including a place known as “the hill,” a spiritual gathering point where they interact with others.

      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>Hey everyone. This is Ky and I just have a few quick announcements and responses to some of your questions. So first off, as I write and edit the final two episodes of the season, I highly recommend listening to episodes 1-8 This is a documentary series that builds upon itself so those early episodes are really essential and everything builds on them. For where we go next, I want to call your attention to episode four. If you might've skipped episode four or didn't listen to the whole thing, I really encourage you to go back and listen to it this week - it really sets the stage for episode nine. 

I've also received many requests to host a live event with some of the families and teachers featured in the series. And that's a great idea. Once I'm done editing and writing these final two episodes, I'll pivot to setting up some live events and zoom chats with the families and teachers and scientists who are willing to do that. 

 If you've joined the test library at thetelepathytapes.com you will be the first receive an invitation. Space for these events will be limited, but after the library members get their invites, I promise I'll post it on our Facebook page on Twitter feeds and all those good things, which you can find at the telepathy tapes. I also want to note that I will be adding more telepathy test to the library, in addition to some more interview bites, some vetted tests from the families that we did early on, and some of Dr. Diane's previous tests. And again, anyone can join the test library at www.thetelepathytapes.com

Thank you again for all your support and engagement. Remember to go back and listen to the episodes you've missed, especially episode four.  

And for any science minded people who may be just jumped in recently, please go back and listen to all episodes. But for you, episode six is essential. 
Episode 9 will be coming in the next week!!

      <title>Ep. 8: Gatekeepers of Truth - Telepathy and the Spelling Controversy</title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In Episode 8 of The Telepathy Tapes, we dive into the controversial world of spelling as a method of communication for non-speakers with autism. This episode reveals the deep divide between families and educators who see spelling as a pathway to independence and those who doubt its legitimacy. Through heartfelt accounts, including a mother’s struggle with her son’s school and the stigmas imposed by professional organizations, we witness the courage of those fighting for non-speakers’ rights to communicate. Expanding the exploration of telepathy beyond spelling, we meet Kyle and his mother Caroline, who communicate solely through dream telepathy and non-verbal communication, demonstrating the boundless forms that connection can take. As we uncover these remarkable experiences, we’re invited to question what we know about communication, autonomy, and the unseen capabilities within us all.

      <title>Ep 7: Telepathy is the Tip of the Iceberg </title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In this episode of The Telepathy Tapes, we explore how nonspeakers might tap into a “foundational consciousness,” connecting them to others’ thoughts, glimpses of the future, and knowledge beyond the physical world. Maura shares her journey with her daughter Emelia, whose spiritual and emotional intelligence transcends her physical limitations. Emelia communicates telepathically not only with her mother but also with friends, teachers, and even strangers.

Teachers, ministers, therapists, and other nonspeakers describe similar experiences, challenging traditional ideas about disability and inspiring questions about a deeper, interconnected consciousness. Host Ky Dickens curates some of the most incredible stories yet, offering a glimpse into the hidden spiritual gifts that challenge our deepest assumptions about consciousness and human potential. Could nonspeakers, like Emelia, help validate a new understanding of consciousness as the basis of reality? For these children, telepathy is just the tip of the iceberg inviting us to consider the profound possibilities their experiences reveal.

      <title>Ep 6: Scientific Evidence for ESP that Shatters the Materialist Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In this highly anticipated science episode, we explore the rich history of telepathy research in both humans and animals, uncovering groundbreaking studies that challenge the materialist worldview. Leading scientists suggest that consciousness, not matter, may be the fundamental building block of the universe—offering a powerful explanation for telepathy and other unexplained phenomena.

We hear from Dr. Diane Hennessy Powell, whose work on telepathy in non-speakers has spanned over a decade, and from Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, a Cambridge biologist whose career was transformed after learning about a blind boy who could seemingly “see” through his mother’s eyes. This discovery led Dr. Sheldrake to study telepathy, particularly in animals, revealing the profound bonds between pets and their owners. Dr. Dean Radin, Chief Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Science, guides us through the history of telepathy research, including the pivotal Ganzfeld studies, which provided strong evidence for the existence of telepathy over the past several decades.

The episode introduces groundbreaking ideas about a new scientific paradigm, where consciousness is viewed as the most fundamental building block of the universe. This shift in thinking could explain many psi phenomena, like telepathy, that the materialist worldview has struggled to account for. By exploring quantum physics, we learn that particles can be connected over great distances, influencing each other instantly—an idea that echoes the potential for human minds to be similarly entangled across space and time. Dr. Marjorie Woolacott, the President of the Academy for the Advancement of Postmaterialist Sciences, also shares how her research supports the idea that consciousness may not be confined to the brain, but rather a pervasive force in the universe.

We also revisit Dr. Sheldrake’s research on telepathic connections between animals and their human companions, including an that demonstrated extraordinary telepathic abilities. These examples push the boundaries of conventional science and open the door to a deeper understanding of consciousness and its role in shaping our reality.

As the episode draws to a close, we discuss the limitations of the materialist paradigm and explore alternative theories of consciousness, setting the stage for the next episode, which promises to dive deeper into the remarkable abilities of non-speaking individuals.

This discovery led Dr. Sheldrake to study telepathy, particularly in animals, revealing the profound bonds between pets and their owners. <strong>Dr. Dean Radin,</strong> Chief Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Science, guides us through the history of telepathy research, including the pivotal Ganzfeld studies, which provided strong evidence for the existence of telepathy over the past several decades.</p><p><br></p><p>The episode introduces groundbreaking ideas about a <strong>new scientific paradigm</strong>, where consciousness is viewed as the most fundamental building block of the universe. This shift in thinking could explain many psi phenomena, like telepathy, that the materialist worldview has struggled to account for. By exploring quantum physics, we learn that particles can be connected over great distances, influencing each other instantly—an idea that echoes the potential for human minds to be similarly entangled across space and time. <strong>Dr. Marjorie Woolacott, </strong>the<strong> </strong>President of the Academy for the Advancement of Postmaterialist Sciences,<strong> </strong>also shares how her research supports the idea that consciousness may not be confined to the brain, but rather a pervasive force in the universe.</p><p><br></p><p>We also revisit Dr. Sheldrake’s research on telepathic connections between animals and their human companions, including an that demonstrated extraordinary telepathic abilities. These examples push the boundaries of conventional science and open the door to a deeper understanding of consciousness and its role in shaping our reality.</p><p><br></p><p>As the episode draws to a close, we discuss the limitations of the materialist paradigm and explore alternative theories of consciousness, setting the stage for the next episode, which promises to dive deeper into the remarkable abilities of non-speaking individuals.</p><p><br></p><p>Please remember you can view the film trailer and some of our telepathy tapes at the website: TheTelepathyTapes.com</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted on Acast.

      <title>Ep. 5: Teachers Break the Silence about Telepathy </title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In this powerful fifth episode of The Telepathy Tapes, the focus shifts to educators who have witnessed telepathy among non-speaking autistic students. The episode shares testimonies from brave teachers like Mary Ann Harrington, Suzy Miller and others, who risked their reputations to discuss their firsthand experiences of students reading minds.

Teachers recount how these experiences were not only shocking but life-changing, offering new insights into human consciousness. As they struggled to be taken seriously by the scientific community, this episode highlights the tension between materialistic scientific paradigms and the reality of telepathy experienced by these teachers and students. With contributions from Dr. Rupert Sheldrake and Dr. Diane Hennessy Powell, the episode delves into the potential of telepathy as a baseline communication method, suggesting that these extraordinary abilities may be the next step in human evolution. Yet, until society fully recognizes this gift, spelling and other methods of communication remain crucial for non-speakers. This episode poses fundamental questions about the nature of consciousness and challenges long-standing assumptions about the human mind.

      <title>Ep 4:  Teen Love with a Twist of Telepathy</title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In Episode 4 of The Telepathy Tapes, Ky Dickens journeys to Atlanta to meet families who openly discuss the extraordinary telepathic abilities of their non-speaking children. The episode centers on John Paul, a 16-year-old with autism, who shares a deep telepathic connection with his friend Houston and his girlfriend Lily. We delve into the unique relationship between John Paul and Lily, who communicate mind-to-mind, revealing a love story that forges a transcendent bond while challenging our conventional understanding of young love.

The episode introduces the concept of savant skills—extraordinary abilities that defy conventional explanations. Savants have exceptional skills in music, language, math and art without any formal training or exposure to the skill. Neuroscientist Dr. Diane Hennacy Powell believes that just as traditional savant skills are accepted despite their mysterious nature, ESP should be acknowledged as a savant skill and studied as a legitimate phenomenon. As we witness telepathy tests and hear from neuroscientists, the episode raises important questions about the nature of consciousness and the societal gatekeeping that often silences these extraordinary experiences.

      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In this episode of “The Telepathy Tapes,” host Ky Dickens heads to Georgia. She is no longer asking if telepathy is possible but how it’s possible. The episode delves into historical and contemporary examples of telepathy, including Lucille Ball’s strange encounter with radio signals through her dental fillings and telepathy experiments by author Upton Sinclair. The narrative deepens as Ky recounts the story of Katie and her non-speaking son, Houston, who can read minds. Houston telepathically engages with other non-speakers in a phenomenon they call “the talk on the hill.” Through rigorous testing, including number generation and UNO card tests, Houston repeatedly demonstrates his telepathic abilities to the amazement of the local Atlanta crew. The episode highlights the challenges faced by families with non-speaking children, their journey to find hope and the potential implications of telepathy as a shared reality, suggesting a profound interconnectedness among humans. The episode sets the stage for further exploration into this mysterious phenomenon in future episodes.

      <title>Ep 2: Telepathy or the merging of consciousness?</title>
      <link>https://thetelepathytapes.com/</link>
      <description>In this gripping episode of The Telepathy Tapes, host Ky Dickens continues the exploration of telepathy in non-speaking individuals, uncovering a phenomenon that goes beyond mere thought transmission. Ky travels to New Jersey to meet Akhil, a college student with nonverbal autism, and his mother, Manisha. What begins as an exploration of telepathy soon reveals something far more profound—a merging of consciousness. Akhil not only reads thoughts but appears to share his mother’s awareness, sensing details about her experiences without being physically present. Through a series of astonishing tests, Akhil demonstrates an ability to perceive the world in ways that challenge the very foundations of science. Akhil demonstrates an uncanny ability to read minds, accurately state randomly generated numbers and words, interpret abstract images, and solve complex equations without ever seeing the inputs. As Ky navigates between scientific skepticism and the lived realities of families like Akhil’s, this episode challenges our understanding of the mind and opens the door to possibilities that defy conventional science. Join Ky as the journey into the mysterious world of telepathy deepens, revealing insights that could reshape how we perceive consciousness, connection and what it truly means to be human.

      <description>The Telepathy Tapes Trailer introduces you to SEASON ONE of the riveting show by host Ky Dickens.
In a world that often dismisses the extraordinary as mere fantasy, The Telepathy Tapes dares to explore the profound abilities of non-speakers with autism—individuals who have long been misunderstood and underestimated. These silent communicators possess gifts that defy conventional understanding, from telepathy to otherworldly perceptions, challenging the limits of what we believe to be real.  For years, their parents and teachers have quietly witnessed these remarkable abilities, knowing that the time to share their truth would eventually come. But now, as the evidence mounts, the time has come to reveal what has been hidden in plain sight. 
This groundbreaking series challenges everything we think we know about communication and the human mind, inviting viewers to step into a reality where the impossible is not only possible but happening every day. Through emotional stories and undeniable evidence, The Telepathy Tapes offers a fresh perspective on the profound connections that exist beyond words. Traveling with Neuroscientist Dr. Diane Hennacy Powell, witnessing mind-boggling telepathy tests and forging deeply intimate relationships with families around the globe - Host Ky Dickens invites you to contemplate the world through the eyes of those who speak without words. Prepare to be captivated, challenged, and ultimately transformed as the series shines a light on the untold capabilities of those who have been underestimated for far too long.
