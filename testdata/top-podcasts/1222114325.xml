      <title>The Anatomy of a Wrongful Conviction</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1987, Ben Spencer, a young black man from Dallas, Texas was convicted in the killing of a white businessman. He was sentenced to life in prison by an all-white jury. There was no physical evidence linking him to the crime and he had an alibi. Over the years, eyewitnesses recanted their testimony and a judge, after reviewing all the prior evidence, declared Spencer to be an innocent man. Nonetheless, Spencer remained in prison for more than three decades. For seven of those years, former NPR correspondent Barbara Bradley Hagerty follows and followed the twists and turns of this case. Her dissection of wrongful convictions and the criminal justice system is at the heart of her new book, <em>Bringing Ben Home: A Murder,  A Conviction And The Fight to Redeem American Justice. <br/><br/></em>Today on The Sunday Story from Up First, part one of a two-part series looking at why it is so hard to get a conviction overturned even when evidence of innocence is overwhelming.

      <title>Sudan's 'Forgotten War'</title>

The current humanitarian crisis in Sudan is seen as one of the worst in the world, but has little global attention. "They forget about us," one exhausted doctor said.

      <title>The Sunday Story: Uncovering Abuse in a Juvenile Detention Center</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the U.S., many kids in trouble with the law are sentenced to juvenile detention facilities. In New Hampshire, the largest such facility is a place commonly known as the Youth Detention Center, or YDC (recently renamed the Sununu Youth Services Center). YDC was founded with good intentions: keep kids out of adult jails and prisons and care for them. But now, nearly 1,300 former residents of YDC have come forward, filing lawsuits over alleged abuse at the facility. The allegations include hundreds of cases of assault and rape that span over six decades. It's become one of the biggest youth detention scandals in American history.<br/><br/>New Hampshire Public Radio's Jason Moon and his colleagues on the Document team spent the last year investigating the Youth Development Center. They combed through the cases, worked around legal roadblocks, and spoke with residents and staff who'd never before told their stories.<br/><br/>This week on <em>The Sunday Story</em>, host Ayesha Roscoe and Moon discuss what may have happened inside YDC and how the allegations stayed under wraps for so long.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The Sunday Story: Is this what democracy looks like?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This week on <em>The Sunday Story</em>, a new series from NPR's Embedded podcast that explores  what happens when one political party has near-complete control. <em>Supermajority</em>, hosted by WPLN reporter Meribah Knight, follows three conservative moms in Tennessee over the course of a year as they learn to navigate their Republican-controlled state legislature. <br/><br/>Reeling from a mass shooting at their kids' school, the three moms become advocates for gun control. But this isn't a story about gun control. It's about what they find when they step inside their state capitol for the first time in their adult lives. These political newcomers confront powerful lawmakers, a dizzying legislative process and most importantly â€“ their own long-held beliefs. What can the women accomplish? How will the work change them? And what might it all reveal about democracy?<br/><br/>Listen to the full series on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embedded"><em>Embedded</em> podcast </a>from NPR.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[This week on <em>The Sunday Story</em>, a new series from NPR's Embedded podcast that explores  what happens when one political party has near-complete control. <em>Supermajority</em>, hosted by WPLN reporter Meribah Knight, follows three conservative moms in Tennessee over the course of a year as they learn to navigate their Republican-controlled state legislature. <br/><br/>Reeling from a mass shooting at their kids' school, the three moms become advocates for gun control. But this isn't a story about gun control. It's about what they find when they step inside their state capitol for the first time in their adult lives. These political newcomers confront powerful lawmakers, a dizzying legislative process and most importantly â€“ their own long-held beliefs. What can the women accomplish? How will the work change them? And what might it all reveal about democracy?<br/><br/>Listen to the full series on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510311/embedded"><em>Embedded</em> podcast </a>from NPR.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Sunday Story: Roy Wood Jr. on the Road to Rickwood</title>
      <description><![CDATA[What does a comedian know about baseball? And what can America's oldest baseball field tell us about the civil rights movement?<br/><br/>Rickwood Field in Birmingham, Alabama is America's oldest ballpark. It's older than Wrigley Field and Fenway park. But its history is full of contradictions. In its heyday, Rickwood was home to both the Birmingham Barons and the Birmingham Black Barons, one of the most talented teams in the Negro Leagues. The field hosted a women's suffrage event, but the stadium's owner also allowed a KKK rally to take place there.<br/><br/>Comedian Roy Wood Jr. hosts a new podcast called <a href="https://www.wwno.org/roadtorickwood"><em>Road to Rickwood </em></a>from WWNO & WRKF, which takes a closer look at the field's history as a microcosm of the civil rights movement itself. Wood Jr. grew up in Birmingham playing baseball at Rickwood. In the podcast, he speaks to historians, civic leaders, major league baseball executives, former Negro Leaguers, and members of Alabama's first integrated sports team. For himself and those he interviewed, baseball was an oasis. It was also a space where racism shaped the lives of some of the nation's best baseball players.<br/><br/>In today's episode of <em>The Sunday Story</em>, Wood Jr. sits down with host Ayesha Rascoe to talk baseball, Birmingham, and race in America.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The Sunday Story: An Indian Political Scandal</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Starting in 2018, sixteen people were arrested in India for allegedly plotting to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi. They included professors, a poet, trade unionists and members of an improv acting troupe. Even an elderly Jesuit priest.<br/><br/>The evidence against them, discovered on their electronic devices, appears damning: minutes of terror cell meetings, emails to banned Maoist rebels and a letter suggesting a suicide attack on Modi.<br/><br/>Today, fifteen defendants continue to await trial. They all say they were falsely accused and that the evidence against them was fabricated and planted by hackers in order to silence them. Digital forensic investigators not only agree but say Modi's own government may be involved.<br/><br/>In this episode of <em>The Sunday Story</em>, NPR's Lauren Frayer follows the twists and turns of what Indian police say was a complex plot to sabotage Modi's government, and that defendants say was a setup. One of the defendants, the Rev.

      <title>The Sunday Story: The Diaspora's Troubled African Dream</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the sleepy town of Asebu, a few miles inland from the Atlantic along Ghana's Cape Coast, a serene 5,000 acre rural settlement is rising out of the palm forests and farmland. <br/><br/>Pan-African Village is envisioned  as an idyllic haven for settlers from the African diaspora. It  was established in 2019, after a  local chief announced that anyone from the diaspora could have plots for free. Hundreds of people, largely from North America and the Caribbean, have accepted the offer and are in the midst of building large homes. <br/><br/>They regard themselves as the first wave of settlers, carving a new life in their ancestral homeland, devoid of racism and repression. But while locals have tentatively welcomed returning diaspora, Ghana is also experiencing some of the worst economic conditions in decades. In Pan-African Village, brewing tensions over ownership and privileged access to the land are threatening to spill over into violence and unravel the promise of  this diaspora haven. <br/><br/>This week on <em>The Sunday Story</em>, producer Andrew Mambo speaks with Emmanuel Akinwotu, NPR's West Africa Correspondent, about the complicated relationship between the diaspora settlers and the place  they see as their ancestral home.<br/><br/>Learn more about sponsor message choices: <a href="https://podcastchoices.com/adchoices">podcastchoices.com/adchoices</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">NPR Privacy Policy</a>]]></description>

      <title>The Sunday Story: The Life And Death Of Elijah McClain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In Colorado, the first of two trials is underway in the death of Elijah McClain.<br/><br/>On a late summer night in 2019, McClain, a 23-year-old Black man, was stopped by police in Aurora, Colorado as he was walking home. McClain was put in a chokehold and injected with a high dose of ketamine. He died several days later in the hospital.<br/><br/>Authorities declined to press charges against police and paramedics involved in the incident, insisting "they had acted consistently with their training." But nearly a year after McCain's death, the case was reopened. Now three police officers and two paramedics face criminal charges including assault, manslaughter and homicide.<br/><br/>Colorado Public Radio justice reporter Allison Sherry has followed McClain's case and the way his legacy has made an impact on policing in Colorado. Today on <em>The Sunday Story</em>, we bring you an excerpt of the audio documentary, "The Life and Death of Elijah Mclain."<br/><br/><em>This story includes graphic descriptions of violence and sounds from body cameras worn by police officers.<br/><br/></em>The full version of this audio documentary is in the podcast <a href="https://www.cpr.org/podcast/colorado-in-depth/">Colorado in Depth</a>.
