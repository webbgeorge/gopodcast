    <description>The Huberman Lab podcast is hosted by Andrew Huberman, Ph.D., a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology, and by courtesy, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. The podcast discusses neuroscience and science-based tools, including how our brain and its connections with the organs of our body control our perceptions, our behaviors, and our health, as well as existing and emerging tools for measuring and changing how our nervous system works.
Huberman has made numerous significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function, and neural plasticity, which is the ability of our nervous system to rewire and learn new behaviors, skills, and cognitive functioning. He is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award, given to the scientist making the most significant discoveries in the study of vision, in 2017. 
Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford School of Medicine has been published in top journals, including Nature, Science, and Cell, and has been featured in TIME, BBC, Scientific American, Discover, and other top media outlets.
In 2021, Dr. Huberman launched the Huberman Lab podcast. The podcast is frequently ranked in the top 10 of all podcasts globally and is often ranked #1 in the categories of Science, Education, and Health &amp; Fitness.</description>

      <title>Essentials: How to Increase Motivation &amp; Drive</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-how-to-increase-motivation-drive</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain the biological mechanism behind motivation and drive, as well as discuss practical tools for overcoming procrastination. 
I discuss the key role dopamine plays in driving cravings and motivating action. I explain how dopamine regulates the balance between pleasure and pain, and what happens when this system becomes dysregulated, leading to addiction. I discuss the role of molecules like serotonin, which help enhance the enjoyment of the present, and explain how to balance the drive for more while staying focused in the present. I also discuss the causes of procrastination and describe strategies to boost dopamine levels through behavioral approaches or supplements. 
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Josh Waitzkin: The Art of Learning &amp; Living Life</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/josh-waitzkin-the-art-of-learning-living-life</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Josh Waitzkin, former child chess prodigy and the subject of the movie and true story Searching for Bobby Fischer. Josh is also a world champion martial arts competitor and the author of the book The Art of Learning. We discuss Josh’s childhood as a chess prodigy and how he learned to train and compete at the highest levels by facing his fears and overcoming points of weakness. He explains the principles that unify disparate physical and mental pursuits and how understanding the interconnectedness of the learning process enables ultra-high-level performance across disciplines.
We explore how to structure one’s day to tap into the most creative, generative, and unique capabilities. Josh shares his approach to learning, including how to address flaws and mistakes and how to harness the subtle and overt energies of the learning and peak performance process. He also discusses how he structures his life and makes decisions related to career and family. This episode is sure to inspire deep thinking and practical life changes for all who listen.

      <title>Essentials: How Foods &amp; Nutrients Control Our Moods</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-how-foods-nutrients-control-our-moods</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how the different nutrients and foods we eat impact our emotions and overall mood.
I discuss how the mind-body connection shapes our food choices and cravings, highlighting the roles of key neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin in driving eating behaviors. I explain the biological mechanisms behind cravings for specific foods, such as sugar, and how psychological factors like belief effects can influence our perception of hunger. I also describe how certain nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids, and a healthy gut microbiome are crucial in mood regulation and immune function.
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Dr. Brian Keating: Charting the Architecture of the Universe &amp; Human Life</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-brian-keating-charting-the-architecture-of-the-universe-human-life</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Brian Keating, Ph.D., a cosmologist and professor of physics at the University of California, San Diego. We discuss the origins of the universe and how humans have used light and optics to understand where and how life on Earth emerged.
We explore how early humans charted the stars, sun, moon, and other celestial events to measure time and track seasons, as well as how stargazing continues to connect us to a shared ancient experience. Additionally, we examine the scientific process, the practical and ethical challenges of pursuing groundbreaking discoveries, and the emotional toll of striving for recognition in one’s profession.
Finally, we discuss whether astrology has any scientific validity and consider the possibility of life beyond Earth.

      <title>Essentials: Tools for Managing Stress &amp; Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-tools-for-managing-stress-anxiety</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain strategies for managing stress, both in the short and long term, to enhance overall well-being.
I explain how the mind and body respond to stress and how acute stress has immune-boosting benefits. I discuss science-supported tools and supplements to better manage stress in real time and protocols for raising one's stress threshold to build resilience to life’s inevitable challenges. I also describe practices to reduce chronic stress and maintain a balanced, healthy life. 
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Essentials: Control Pain &amp; Heal Faster With Your Brain</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-control-pain-heal-faster-with-your-brain</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how to manage pain and accelerate injury recovery by leveraging protocols to modulate pain perception. 
I discuss how pain interpretation is a complex experience, shaped by both internal factors like emotions and genetics, as well as external factors, such as context. I explain how practical strategies like acupuncture, breathing techniques, exercise and temperature modulation can influence the body’s pain response and accelerate recovery. I also discuss topics like phantom limb pain, recovering from traumatic brain injury and the crucial role inflammation plays in the healing process. 
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>How to Use Exercise to Improve Your Brain’s Health, Longevity &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-use-exercise-to-improve-your-brains-health-longevity-performance</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how different forms of exercise impact brain health and performance in both the short and long term. I explain how many of the positive effects of exercise on brain function occur through the action of specific neurochemicals that increase alertness.
I also cover how to best time exercise and which specific types of exercise to include in your weekly routine to maximize benefits for your brain. Additionally, I explain how certain types of exercise trigger the release of a hormone from your bones called osteocalcin, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Together, these substances increase neuroplasticity and enhance learning.
The positive effects of exercise on brain oxygenation, blood supply, and fuel utilization are also discussed. Listeners will learn how to design a weekly exercise program that optimizes physical fitness, brain health, longevity, and performance, along with the mechanistic logic behind those recommendations.

      <title>Essentials: Optimize Your Learning &amp; Creativity With Science-Based Tools</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-optimize-your-learning-creativity-with-science-based-tools</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how to boost creativity and enhance learning by aligning with the body’s natural rhythms and strategically using protocols to optimize states of alertness or calm.
I outline tools to improve focus and learning, including when to use specific techniques based on the time of day and how to adjust focus and tasks according to energy levels. I also discuss the two essential components of creativity and explain how to structure productive, creative work sessions. By combining biological tools — such as exercise, meals, hydration, and sleep — with subjective methods like music, I demonstrate how to tailor your approach to align with your unique biological rhythms and individual goals, fostering greater creativity and learning.
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes, approximately 30 minutes, focused on key scientific and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials are released every Thursday, while full-length episodes continue to be released every Monday.

      <title>Dr. Jordan Peterson: How to Best Guide Your Life Decisions &amp; Path</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-jordan-peterson-how-to-best-guide-your-life-decisions-path</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jordan Peterson, Ph.D., psychologist, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, best-selling author, and prominent online educator. We discuss the biology of human emotions and motivations, healthy versus destructive impulses, addictions, and generative drives. Topics include how brain states shape decision-making—for better or worse—and how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life.
We also explore the innate human drive to create "impact at a distance" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time.
Listeners will gain practical knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, my guest is <a href="https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/">Dr. Jordan Peterson, Ph.D.</a>, psychologist, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, <a href="https://amzlink.to/az0woBkDzpJTZ">best-selling author</a>, and prominent online educator. We discuss the biology of human emotions and motivations, healthy versus destructive impulses, addictions, and generative drives. Topics include how brain states shape decision-making—for better or worse—and how religion and culture can guide us toward and through the best paths in life.</p><p>We also explore the innate human drive to create "impact at a distance" and how it influences social interactions, educational pursuits, career choices, and relationships. Additional subjects include morality, social media, politics, the human appetite for drama, and the importance of embracing responsibility as a form of adventure to avoid wasting time.</p><p>Listeners will gain practical knowledge from psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and religion.</p><p>Read the full show notes at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-jordan-peterson-how-to-best-guide-your-life-decisions-path">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://drinkag1.com/huberman">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>David: <a href="https://davidprotein.com/huberman">https://davidprotein.com/huberman</a></p><p>Levels: <a href="https://levels.link/huberman">https://levels.link/huberman</a></p><p>ROKA: <a href="https://roka.com/huberman">https://roka.com/huberman</a></p><p>Function: <a href="https://functionhealth.com/huberman">https://functionhealth.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://drinklmnt.com/huberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Dr. Jordan Peterson</p><p>00:02:32 Sponsors: David &amp; Levels</p><p>00:05:19 Brain, Impulses, Integration, Personalities</p><p>00:14:08 Personalities, Motivation</p><p>00:18:18 Context &amp; Children; Religion, Motivation &amp; Personality</p><p>00:24:08 Hypothalamus, Context, Maturation</p><p>00:29:46 Psychopathy, Kids &amp; Aggressive Behavior &amp; Socialization</p><p>00:33:37 Polytheistic &amp; Monotheistic Religions; Rage, Sociopathy &amp; Addiction</p><p>00:41:05 Sponsors: AG1 &amp; ROKA</p><p>00:43:58 Belief in God, Addiction</p><p>00:50:34 Pornography, Dopamine, Processed Foods</p><p>00:56:20 Clean Diet, Satiety; Fundamental Pleasures, Food, Sexuality</p><p>01:04:44 Power, Target, Sin</p><p>01:06:46 Sponsor: Function</p><p>01:08:33 Abraham; Call to Adventure, Success, Respect, Community</p><p>01:21:30 Wisdom, Noah; Religion, Incentive Structure &amp; Motivation</p><p>01:26:52 Dopamine &amp; Target, Sin; Frontal Eye Fields</p><p>01:31:59 Meta-Target &amp; Goals, Sermon on the Mount; Fears</p><p>01:40:36 Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>01:41:51 Ultimate vs. Local Victory, Pearl of Great Price</p><p>01:45:05 Time Scales &amp; Rewards; Entropy, Dopamine &amp; Goals</p><p>01:51:20 Pornography, Effortless Gratification; Revelation &amp; Sexuality Demise</p><p>02:02:33 Adventure &amp; Responsibility, Sacrifice; Tool: Ordering Room</p><p>02:12:02 Storytelling, Science, Career Advancement, Pursuing Truth</p><p>02:23:46 Abraham &amp; Adventure; Purposeful Satisfaction, Podcast</p><p>02:28:13 Finding Your Calling, Tools: Calling &amp; Conscience; Creating Order</p><p>02:35:06 Order vs. Chaos; Public Shootings, Narcissism</p><p>02:40:16 Long-Term Goals, Pursuit, Curiosity, Commitment</p><p>02:45:43 Finding Purpose, Tool: Fixing Messes; Conscience &amp; Voice of Divine</p><p>02:54:26 Prayer, Aim, Revelation; Thought</p><p>03:00:34 Religion, Common Themes</p><p>03:10:55 Psychoanalytical Traditions; Play</p><p>03:19:23 Play; Humor, Discourse, Alternative Media</p><p>03:27:18 Democrats, Republicans; Fear &amp; Growth</p><p>03:34:59 Tour, Peterson Academy, YouTube, Cancel Culture</p><p>03:48:30 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Follow &amp; Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Essentials: How to Learn Faster by Using Failures, Movement &amp; Balance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-how-to-learn-faster-by-using-failures-movement-balance</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how making mistakes and perceived frustration drive learning and how movement enhances the brain’s adaptability. 
I explain how making errors triggers the release of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, which are essential for learning. I also discuss the differences between how neuroplasticity occurs in children and adults, focusing on the varying requirements and effort needed for learning. I discuss science-supported learning strategies for adults, including small practice bouts, leveraging frustration, regulating your autonomic state, and using movement to maximize focus and neuroplasticity. 
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Dr. Laurie Santos: How to Achieve True Happiness Using Science-Based Protocols</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-laurie-santos-how-to-achieve-true-happiness-using-science-based-protocols</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Laurie Santos, Ph.D., a professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University and a leading researcher on happiness and fulfillment. We discuss what truly increases happiness, examining factors such as money, social comparison, free time, alone time versus time spent with others, pets, and the surprising positive impact of negative visualizations. We also explore common myths and truths about introverts and extroverts, the science of motivation, and how to adjust your hedonic set point to experience significantly more joy in daily life. Throughout the episode, Dr. Santos shares science-supported strategies for enhancing emotional well-being and cultivating a deeper sense of meaning and happiness.

      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-how-to-focus-to-change-your-brain</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain how neuroplasticity allows the brain to continue to adapt and change throughout life, particularly through focused attention and active engagement in learning.
I explain how neuroplasticity differs in children and adults, highlighting the key neurochemicals required for adult learning. I explain science-supported protocols to boost alertness and improve attention, including techniques like visual focus and goal accountability. I also discuss how sleep, along with practices such as non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) and naps, support the brain to enhance learning. 
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Dr. Bernardo Huberman: How to Use Curiosity &amp; Focus to Create a Joyful &amp; Meaningful Life</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-bernardo-huberman-how-to-use-curiosity-focus-to-create-a-joyful-meaningful-life</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Bernardo Huberman, Ph.D., a research physicist, expert on quantum networks, and vice president of CableLabs’ Next-Gen Systems. We discuss his journey into science, beginning in South America, how a curiosity about physics led him to the United States, and how his hunger for studying novel problems guided him into fields like physics, computer science, biology, economics, and, most recently, quantum computing. He explains relativity theory, chaos theory, fractals, and quantum internet in terms anyone can understand.
We explore how curiosity has continually guided his decisions about what to study and how to live, and how researching hard, even abstract, problems can serve as a model for staying grounded and enjoying everyday life. We also discuss meditation, spirituality, and why continually asking questions about how the world is organized can bring about an immense and lasting sense of meaning and joy.

      <title>Essentials: Understand and Use Dreams to Learn and Forget</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-understanding-and-using-dreams-to-learn-and-to-forget</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explain the important role that sleep and dreams have in learning, regulating emotions, and recovering from trauma.
I discuss how dreams during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep contribute to emotional learning and the processing of traumatic experiences. I also discuss the similarities of REM dreams to clinical treatments like ketamine and EMDR therapy. I explain how non-REM dreams function differently to support other types of learning. Additionally, I describe science-backed strategies to optimize both types of sleep for improved learning, mood and emotional regulation.
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-kelly-starrett-how-to-improve-your-mobility-posture-flexibility</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Kelly Starrett, DPT, a world-renowned physical therapist, best-selling author, and expert on improving movement in fitness, sports, and daily life. We discuss strategies to enhance mobility and flexibility to boost physical performance and overall health, including ways to offset aging, heal from injuries faster, and correct movement or strength imbalances. Topics include zero- and low-cost tools, such as how to warm up effectively, prepare mentally for workouts, properly use foam rollers, perform fascial release, and apply heat or cold for pain management and tissue recovery. We also cover the best flexibility protocols. Dr. Starrett explains how to optimize default postures for sitting, standing, and everyday activities. Listeners will gain practical, easy-to-implement knowledge to improve their health and physical performance.

      <title>Essentials: How to Defeat Jet Lag, Shift Work &amp; Sleeplessness</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-how-to-defeat-jet-lag-shift-work-sleeplessness</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I explore science-backed protocols to combat jet lag, manage shift work, and optimize sleep across different stages of life.  
I discuss “temperature minimum” — a simple and reliable measurement that helps you quickly adjust to new time zones and counteract the negative effects of nocturnal shift work. I also provide actionable tools for regulating sleep and wake cycles in babies and new parents.  
The episode emphasizes the critical role of circadian rhythms, influenced by factors like light exposure, temperature regulation, and eating schedules. Practical tools include using light to shift your circadian clock, understanding the role of temperature in sleep, and adopting strategies to improve rest without medication. Whether you’re a shift worker, a parent of a newborn, or someone facing sleep challenges, this episode offers valuable guidance for enhancing recovery and overall well-being.
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Morgan Housel: Understand &amp; Apply the Psychology of Money to Gain Greater Happiness</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/morgan-housel-understand-apply-the-psychology-of-money-to-gain-greater-happiness</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Morgan Housel, an expert in private wealth generation and management and author of the bestselling book The Psychology of Money. We discuss how desiring, pursuing, saving, and spending money impact our psychology and perception of wealth. We explore why people tend to either overspend or oversave and examine the most common mistakes made in the pursuit of financial freedom. Additionally, we discuss how to best use money — and one’s relationship with it — as a tool to create psychological security, freedom, and a deeper sense of life purpose.
We also delve into the impact of purchases, social media, and wealth signaling on our internal reward circuits, the dangers of using money as a gauge of career progress or self-worth, and the healthiest psychological stances to adopt while building wealth at any level. By the end of the episode, listeners will have gained numerous practical tools for making smarter financial decisions and should have a clearer understanding of the role money plays in their psychology, happiness, and life.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Morgan Housel, an expert in private wealth generation and management and author of the bestselling book The Psychology of Money. We discuss how desiring, pursuing, saving, and spending money impact our psychology and perception of wealth. We explore why people tend to either overspend or oversave and examine the most common mistakes made in the pursuit of financial freedom. Additionally, we discuss how to best use money — and one’s relationship with it — as a tool to create psychological security, freedom, and a deeper sense of life purpose.
We also delve into the impact of purchases, social media, and wealth signaling on our internal reward circuits, the dangers of using money as a gauge of career progress or self-worth, and the healthiest psychological stances to adopt while building wealth at any level. By the end of the episode, listeners will have gained numerous practical tools for making smarter financial decisions and should have a clearer understanding of the role money plays in their psychology, happiness, and life.

      <title>Essentials: Using Science to Optimize Sleep, Learning &amp; Metabolism</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-using-science-to-optimize-sleep-learning-metabolism</link>
      <description>In this Huberman Lab Essentials episode, I answer your most frequently asked questions about science-backed tools for improving alertness, enhancing learning, and achieving quality sleep. I also discuss the optimal times for exercising and eating, how to properly time light exposure, as well as methods for strategically adjusting your body temperature to influence your nervous system.
Huberman Lab Essentials are short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes. Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Dr. Ethan Kross: How to Control Your Inner Voice &amp; Increase Your Resilience</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-ethan-kross-how-to-control-your-inner-voice-increase-your-resilience</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Ethan Kross, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, director of the Emotion &amp; Self-Control Laboratory, and author of the bestselling book Chatter. We discuss the purpose of the inner voice in your head and its impact on emotional well-being and motivation.
We also explore practical tools to manage negative internal chatter and eliminate intrusive thoughts. Topics include how music, exercise, mental distancing techniques, and expressive writing can help rescript your inner dialogue to be self-encouraging and effective in creating outward behavioral changes. Dr. Kross explains why venting to others is self-defeating and offers better alternatives. Throughout the episode, he provides research-supported, actionable protocols to help you shift your internal dialogue and accompanying emotional state, fostering greater happiness and resilience.

      <title>Dr. Terry Sejnowski: How to Improve at Learning Using Neuroscience &amp; AI</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-terry-sejnowski-how-to-improve-at-learning-using-neuroscience-ai</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Terry Sejnowski, Ph.D., professor of computational neurobiology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He is world-renowned for exploring how our brain processes and stores information and, with that understanding, for developing tools that enable us to markedly improve our ability to learn all types of information and skills.
We discuss how to learn most effectively in order to truly master a subject or skill. Dr. Sejnowski explains how to use AI tools to forage for new information, generate ideas, predict the future, and assist in analyzing health data and making health-related decisions.
We also explore non-AI strategies to enhance learning and creativity, including how specific types of exercise can improve mitochondrial function and cognitive performance. Listeners will gain insights into how computational methods and AI are transforming our understanding of brain function, learning, and memory, as well as the emerging roles of these tools in addressing personal health and treating brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

      <title>Essentials: How Your Brain Works &amp; Changes</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/essentials-how-your-nervous-system-works-changes</link>
      <description>This is the first episode of Huberman Lab Essentials — short episodes (approximately 30 minutes) focused on essential science and protocol takeaways from past Huberman Lab episodes.
This Essentials episode introduces how the nervous system creates sensations, perceptions, emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, as well as how we can change our nervous system — a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity.
Essentials will be released every Thursday, and our full-length episodes will still be released every Monday.

      <title>Dr. Allan Schore: How Relationships Shape Your Brain</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-allan-schore-how-relationships-shape-your-brain</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Allan Schore, Ph.D., a faculty member in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles, a longtime clinical psychotherapist, and a multi-book author. We discuss how early child-parent interactions shape brain circuitry, impacting our ability to form attachments, manage emotions, and navigate conflict and stress. We cover how the development of right-brain circuitry related to emotional processing and the unconscious mind regulates physiological responses, influencing adult friendships and romantic relationships. We also explore how improving your ability to listen to the emotional tone—rather than just the meaning—of words is a vital skill for fostering better relationships with yourself and others, and how it plays a role in reshaping brain circuitry.

Additionally, we explain how circuits in the right brain hemisphere drive creativity and intuition and discuss activities to access the unconscious mind. This episode delves into how the unconscious mind regulates emotions—both your own and others’—and shapes our sense of self. By the end, you’ll have new knowledge and tools to build more secure, meaningful, and impactful connections of all kinds: professional, romantic, familial, friendships, and beyond.

      <title>Dr. Shanna Swan: How to Safeguard Your Hormone Health &amp; Fertility</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-shanna-swan-how-to-safeguard-your-hormone-health-fertility</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Shanna Swan, Ph.D., professor of environmental medicine and reproductive health at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Dr. Swan is the world’s leading expert on the harmful impact of chemicals in our food, water, cosmetics, and various household and consumer products on our hormones, and the consequences for fertility and overall reproductive health. She explains how exposure to phthalates and other endocrine disruptors adversely impacts fetal development, puberty, and the adult brain and body. We discuss the global decline in human fertility due to disruptive environmental toxins, such as pesticides, and certain foods and beverages we consume.

We discuss practical strategies to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), BPS, and PFAS. This includes reducing disposable plastic use, making healthier food preparation, consumption, and storage choices, and selecting personal and household products that don’t contain harmful toxins. This episode allows you to assess your risk of exposure to endocrine disruptors accurately and empowers you to take control of your hormone health and fertility.

      <title>Bill Eddy: How to Deal With High Conflict People</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/bill-eddy-how-to-deal-with-high-conflict-people</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Bill Eddy, a lawyer, licensed therapist, professional mediator, and faculty member at the Pepperdine University School of Law. He specializes in identifying, reducing friction with, and disentangling from high-conflict individuals. We explain how high-conflict personalities differ from personality disorders and examine the cycles of blame and drama that cause persistent conflict in their relationships.

We discuss how to quickly recognize high-conflict individuals based on specific criteria and behaviors, helping listeners learn to spot their less obvious tactics. You’ll also learn how to disengage from them with minimal friction and understand the methods they use to draw people back in or keep conflict alive.

Additionally, we cover effective communication strategies for mediating situations involving high-conflict individuals, emphasizing empathy and problem-solving approaches. This episode equips listeners with tools to navigate conflict in various contexts, promoting resolutions that benefit all parties involved.

      <title>The Effects of Microplastics on Your Health &amp; How to Reduce Them</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-effects-of-microplastics-on-your-health-how-to-reduce-them</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain what microplastics are, their prevalence in the human body and environment, and their common sources, as well as their potential negative health impacts. I provide practical strategies for limiting exposure to microplastics, nanoplastics, and endocrine disruptors such as bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), phthalates, and PFAS ("forever chemicals"). Additionally, I discuss methods to enhance the body's detoxification and excretion of microplastics.

By the end of this episode, you will have a clear understanding of the modern science of microplastics and their impact on human biology, along with actionable steps to minimize exposure and accumulation in the brain and body.

      <title>Ari Wallach: Create Your Ideal Future Using Science-Based Protocols</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ari-wallach-create-your-ideal-future-using-science-based-protocols</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Ari Wallach, most recently an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and host of a new TV series titled A Brief History of the Future. We discuss the importance of learning to project our understanding of ourselves and our goals into the future, both for our own sake and for future generations. We also explore how this fosters a sense of unity and community within our species.
We examine how technology and modern society influence our perception of time and our ability to make decisions in a fast-paced, reward-driven environment that leads to our best possible future. Additionally, we discuss how the dismantling of traditional institutions has altered people's sense of purpose. We outline protocols to cultivate long-term thinking, connect with core values, and define a deep sense of purpose. This episode provides listeners with actionable tools to merge short- and long-term thinking in ways that create a positive, lasting impact on ourselves, society, and the planet.

Additionally, we discuss how the dismantling of traditional institutions has altered people's sense of purpose. We outline protocols to cultivate long-term thinking, connect with core values, and define a deep sense of purpose. This episode provides listeners with actionable tools to merge short- and long-term thinking in ways that create a positive, lasting impact on ourselves, society, and the planet.

      <title>Dr. Craig Koniver: Peptide &amp; Hormone Therapies for Health, Performance &amp; Longevity</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-craig-koniver-peptide-hormone-therapies-for-health-performance-longevity</link>
      <description>In this episode, Dr. Craig Koniver, M.D., a board-certified physician trained at Brown University and Thomas Jefferson University, discusses the therapeutic application of peptides and hormones for enhancing physical and mental health and performance.
We explore GLP-1 analogs for weight loss, BPC-157 for wound healing and reducing inflammation, as well as peptides that increase growth hormone, improve REM sleep, and enhance cognitive function. We also cover testosterone therapy, NAD, NMN, and NR supplementation, methylene blue for mitochondrial health, stem cell therapies, and supplements such as CoEnzyme Q10 and methylated B vitamins.
Additionally, we discuss effective dosages, sourcing, safety considerations, and the importance of working with knowledgeable physicians. Whether you're currently using peptides or exogenous hormones, or simply curious about their potential benefits and risks, this episode provides the scientific rationale behind how peptides function, their potential to enhance mental and physical health, and how they can optimize performance.

      <title>Dr. Charan Ranganath: How to Improve Memory &amp; Focus Using Science Protocols</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-charan-ranganath-how-to-improve-memory-focus-using-science-protocols</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Charan Ranganath, Ph.D., professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of California, Davis, and a world expert on the neuroscience of memory. We discuss how memory works, what causes diseases of dementia like Alzheimer’s, and science-based strategies to reduce age-related cognitive decline. We also cover the essential role of curiosity and the dopamine-curiosity link that can assist memory formation and neuroplasticity.
We then discuss challenges with attention and focus, and how to overcome them, as well as how to manage task-switching and create home and work environments more conducive to cognitive health and longevity. Additionally, we explore the emotional aspect of memories, tools for overcoming rumination, and strategies for reframing past negative experiences.
This episode will be of interest to anyone seeking to improve and maintain their cognitive health, focus, and memory across their lifespan, as well as for those struggling with ADHD.

      <title>Dr. Victor Carrión: How to Heal From Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-victor-carrion-how-to-heal-from-post-traumatic-stress-disorder</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Victor Carrión, M.D., the Vice-Chair of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Stanford School of Medicine and a world expert on the understanding and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children, adolescents, and adults.
We explain why, as children, we are particularly vulnerable to PTSD and how stress and trauma affect the developing brain. We also discuss how PTSD is related to attention-deficient hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and vice versa.
Dr. Carrión shares effective therapeutic interventions for PTSD, including cue-centered therapy (CCT) and how to create a custom “toolbox” to help you identify triggers and manage stress. We discuss an emerging curriculum that combines yoga and mindfulness to help people with PTSD improve their stress resilience, mood, and sleep.
The episode will provide listeners of all ages with a clear understanding of PTSD and effective strategies to heal from it.

      <title>Dr. Marc Brackett: How to Increase Your Emotional Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-marc-brackett-how-to-increase-your-emotional-intelligence</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Marc Brackett, Ph.D., a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale University, director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, and a world expert on what emotions are, how to interpret them, and how to work with emotions to yield a more impactful, meaningful and healthier life. We explore differences between introverts and extroverts, in-person and text-based emotional communication, and how emotional suppression impacts us.
We discuss emotional intelligence and describe tools to improve emotional regulation and communication in personal and professional relationships. We also explore the role of emotions in learning, resolving conflicts, and decision-making. We also discuss bullying in kids and adults, both in person and online. This episode provides a clear and novel framework for thinking about emotions and data-supported tools to improve emotion regulation, self-awareness, and empathic attunement.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Marc Brackett, Ph.D., a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale University, director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, and a world expert on what emotions are, how to interpret them, and how to work with emotions to yield a more impactful, meaningful and healthier life. We explore differences between introverts and extroverts, in-person and text-based emotional communication, and how emotional suppression impacts us.
We discuss emotional intelligence and describe tools to improve emotional regulation and communication in personal and professional relationships. We also explore the role of emotions in learning, resolving conflicts, and decision-making. We also discuss bullying in kids and adults, both in person and online. This episode provides a clear and novel framework for thinking about emotions and data-supported tools to improve emotion regulation, self-awareness, and empathic attunement.

      <title>Dr. Jamil Zaki: How to Cultivate a Positive, Growth-Oriented Mindset</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-jamil-zaki-how-to-cultivate-a-positive-growth-oriented-mindset</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jamil Zaki, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Stanford University, director of the Stanford Social Neuroscience Laboratory, and the author of the new book Hope for Cynics. We discuss cynicism and its healthier, more adaptive alternative, healthy skepticism, and how embracing healthy skepticism can enhance both our emotional and physical health.
We discuss the data on how cynicism affects us as individuals and in relationships, causing lower levels of happiness, poorer physical health, and reduced creativity, trust, and collaboration. He also explains novel data-supported tools that we can use to shift ourselves towards a more informed yet more positive worldview and how to adopt a mindset of “hopeful skepticism” — the ideal stance to navigate life. 
Dr. Zaki offers listeners a positive, hopeful view of humanity grounded in cutting-edge research from his laboratory and other top laboratories. He also offers science-supported protocols to navigate relationships in person and online better.

      <title>Optimal Protocols for Studying &amp; Learning</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/optimal-protocols-for-studying-learning</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss science-supported protocols to optimize your depth and rate of learning of material and skills. I explain the neurobiology of learning and neuroplasticity and how correctly timed, self-directed test-taking can be leveraged to improve learning and prevent forgetting. 
I discuss the study habits of the most successful learners, ways to limit distractions, how to set study goals, and how tests can be used as tools to learn, not just as a means for evaluating one’s mastery of learned material. A surprising aspect of tests, specifically self-testing soon after exposure to new material, is that they can significantly improve your ability to learn, apply, and maintain new knowledge. I also discuss tools to improve focus and alertness while studying.
By the end of this episode, you will have learned various science-supported actionable tools you can use to better learn, remember, and apply new information.

I also discuss tools to improve focus and alertness while studying.</p><p>By the end of this episode, you will have learned various science-supported actionable tools you can use to better learn, remember, and apply new information.</p><p>Access the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/optimal-protocols-for-studying-learning">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Andrew's New Book</h2><p><em>Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body</em>: <a href="https://protocolsbook.com/">https://protocolsbook.com</a></p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://drinkag1.com/huberman">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a> </p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href="https://eightsleep.com/huberman%C2%A0">https://eightsleep.com/huberman </a></p><p>BetterHelp: <a href="https://betterhelp.com/huberman">https://betterhelp.com/huberman</a> </p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a> </p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://drinklmnt.com/huberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a> </p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Improve Studying &amp; Learning</p><p>00:02:11 Sponsors: Eight Sleep, BetterHelp &amp; Waking Up</p><p>00:06:45 Offsetting Forgetting</p><p>00:08:22 Learning &amp; Neuroplasticity</p><p>00:13:06 Periodic Testing</p><p>00:16:09 Focus &amp; Alertness, Sleep, Tool: Active Engagement</p><p>00:21:37 Tool: Improve Focus, Mindfulness Meditation, Perception Exercise</p><p>00:24:38 Sleep &amp; Neuroplasticity, Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)</p><p>00:28:29 Tools: Study Habits of Successful Students</p><p>00:36:21 Sponsor: AG1</p><p>00:37:33 Studying &amp; Aspiration Goals; Challenging Material</p><p>00:42:54 Tool: Testing as a Learning Tool</p><p>00:48:23 Self-Testing, Repeated Testing</p><p>00:55:29 Testing Yourself &amp; Knowledge Gaps</p><p>01:01:11 Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>01:02:23 New Material &amp; Self-Test Timing</p><p>01:07:21 Familiarity vs Mastery</p><p>01:10:55 Self-Testing &amp; Offsetting Forgetting</p><p>01:15:53 Best Type of Self-Tests; Phone &amp; Post-Learning Distractions</p><p>01:22:03 Tool: Gap Effects; Testing as Studying vs. Evaluation</p><p>01:25:40 Tool: Emotion &amp; Learning, PTSD, Deliberate Cold Exposure, Caffeine</p><p>01:33:28 Tool: Interleaving Information; Unskilled, Mastery &amp; Virtuosity</p><p>01:39:10 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Follow &amp; Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Teo Soleymani: How to Improve &amp; Protect Your Skin Health &amp; Appearance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-teo-soleymani-how-to-improve-protect-your-skin-health-appearance</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Teo Soleymani, M.D., a double-board-certified dermatologist and specialist in skin cancer and reconstructive surgery. We discuss science and clinically supported protocols to improve skin health and give your skin a more youthful appearance and structure, reducing premature aging and skin cancer risk.
We discuss the impact of sun exposure on skin appearance and aging and the surprising relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer. We explain how mineral-based (inorganic) sunscreens differ from chemical (organic) sunscreens, whether sunscreen can minimize premature skin aging, reduce cancer risk, and if there are any health risks associated with sunscreen use.
We discuss skincare routines to significantly improve skin appearance and how to select skincare products. We discuss how caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and stress impact the skin and describe how nutrition and anti-inflammatory diets can improve skin health. We also discuss the causes and treatments for common skin conditions, including dandruff, acne, rosacea, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo.
Our conversation also covers topics such as the use of retinoids, laser treatments, red-light phototherapy, supplements, and how to best monitor for skin cancer. This episode provides numerous actionable protocols, most of which are zero-to-low cost, for improving skin health and appearance, reducing cancer risk, and treating skin problems.

      <title>Dr. Layne Norton: Tools for Nutrition &amp; Fitness</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-layne-norton-tools-for-nutrition-fitness</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Layne Norton, Ph.D., one of the world’s top experts in nutrition and training for physical fitness. We discuss how to evaluate scientific evidence and the validity of different practices aimed at achieving fat loss, muscle strength and hypertrophy, microbiome health, vitality, and longevity.
We explore many hotly debated topics, including fasting, seed oils, saturated fats, sugar, red meat, artificial/low-calorie sweeteners, and GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic). Additionally, we delve into the timing of protein and carbohydrate intake relative to fasting and exercise, fat loss and sleep, and the benefits of dietary protein and fiber on overall health.
We also discuss how to accelerate hypertrophy and fat loss, improve strength, whether we need to train to “failure,” how to enhance exercise recovery, and how to manage pain. We cover training before versus after age 50, whether metabolism changes with age, and the connection between muscle health and longevity. We also address why certain behaviors and supplements might work for some people but not others.
Listeners to this episode will benefit greatly from Layne’s science-based expertise on a wide range of topics, including health, nutrition, and fitness.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, my guest is <a href="https://biolayne.com/coach/layne-norton/">Dr. Layne Norton, Ph.D.</a>, one of the world’s top experts in nutrition and training for physical fitness. We discuss how to evaluate scientific evidence and the validity of different practices aimed at achieving fat loss, muscle strength and hypertrophy, microbiome health, vitality, and longevity.</p><p>We explore many hotly debated topics, including fasting, seed oils, saturated fats, sugar, red meat, artificial/low-calorie sweeteners, and GLP-1 agonists (e.g., Ozempic). Additionally, we delve into the timing of protein and carbohydrate intake relative to fasting and exercise, fat loss and sleep, and the benefits of dietary protein and fiber on overall health.</p><p>We also discuss how to accelerate hypertrophy and fat loss, improve strength, whether we need to train to “failure,” how to enhance exercise recovery, and how to manage pain. We cover training before versus after age 50, whether metabolism changes with age, and the connection between muscle health and longevity. We also address why certain behaviors and supplements might work for some people but not others.</p><p>Listeners to this episode will benefit greatly from Layne’s science-based expertise on a wide range of topics, including health, nutrition, and fitness.</p><p>Access the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-layne-norton-tools-for-nutrition-fitness">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://drinkag1.com/huberman">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>Mateina: <a href="https://drinkmateina.com/huberman">https://drinkmateina.com/huberman</a></p><p>Eight Sleep: <a href="https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman">https://www.eightsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>Maui Nui: <a href="https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman">https://mauinuivenison.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://drinklmnt.com/huberman">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Dr. Layne Norton</p><p>00:01:49 Sponsors: Mateina, Eight Sleep, Maui Nui</p><p>00:06:39 Science-Based Evidence, Mechanism vs. Outcome</p><p>00:14:31 Meta-analysis, Methods, Evidence Quality</p><p>00:22:45 Evidence Hierarchy, Randomized Controlled Trials, Cohort Data</p><p>00:33:53 Sponsor: AG1</p><p>00:35:05 “Don’t Turn Your Brain Off”; Protein Synthesis</p><p>00:42:01 Protein Synthesis, Refractory Response; Resistance Training  </p><p>00:46:05 Protein Intake, Intermittent Fasting &amp; Training</p><p>00:54:52 Tool: Total Protein Intake, Distribution &amp; Protein Synthesis</p><p>01:00:25 Muscle Quality, Protein Remodeling, Muscle Growth</p><p>01:05:34 Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>01:06:46 Early vs. Late Time-Restricted Eating; Fasting Blood Glucose &amp; HbA1c</p><p>01:10:30 Carbohydrate Timing, Individual Response, Placebo; Tool: Tracking Diet</p><p>01:19:50 “The Norton Method”; Tool: Consistency</p><p>01:25:16 Resistance &amp; Cardiovascular Training; Competition; Immune System &amp; Rest</p><p>01:33:50 Mind &amp; Body Effects, Stress; Belief Effects</p><p>01:41:30 Training to Failure, Reps in Reserve, Hypertrophy &amp; Strength Training</p><p>01:50:24 Fatigue &amp; Training to Failure, Speed, Strength Training</p><p>01:59:06 Tool: Training After 50, Consistency</p><p>02:09:12 Fat Cells, Diabetes, Exercise</p><p>02:16:50 Metabolism &amp; Age-Related Changes?, Appetite</p><p>02:23:17 Ozempic, Mounjaro, GLP-1 Agonists, Lean Mass, “Food Noise”</p><p>02:33:42 GLP-1 Agonists, Judgement &amp; Obesity</p><p>02:40:19 Sugar, Excess Calories, Body Weight</p><p>02:49:16 Satiety, Sugar &amp; Calorie Budget</p><p>02:54:56 Tool: Individualization, Context &amp; Diet Psychology</p><p>02:57:22 Seed Oils, Butter, Olive Oil</p><p>03:06:56 Red Meat, Carcinogenic?; Simple Diet; Fiber Benefits</p><p>03:13:43 Saturated Fat, Cholesterol; Seed Oils</p><p>03:18:41 Artificial &amp; Low-Calorie Sweeteners, Insulin, Appetite</p><p>03:29:06 Artificial &amp; Low-Calorie Sweeteners, Gut Microbiome; Cancer</p><p>03:37:58 Tools: Training Recovery, Glycogen Replenishment; Stress &amp; Activity</p><p>03:45:56 Collagen Supplementation, Skin &amp; Nails, Whey Protein</p><p>03:57:00 Evidence-Based Approach</p><p>04:01:41 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Follow &amp; Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <description>Welcome to a special edition of the 18th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium. This episode is a recording of the live stream AMA, exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.

Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation and other donors.
If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more.

      <title>Dr. Peter Attia: Supplements for Longevity &amp; Their Efficacy </title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-peter-attia-supplements-for-longevity-their-efficacy</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine-trained physician expert in improving human healthspan and lifespan. Dr. Attia is also the host of The Drive podcast and author of the best-selling book Outlive. 
We discuss the NAD pathway in human cells and its possible links to aging and health. We evaluate how supplementation can augment molecules in the NAD pathway; we compare NAD, NMN, and NR, different routes of administration, their safety, and bioavailability. Then, we discuss the broader research and clinical literature on longevity to decide if supplementation with NAD, NR, NMN, rapamycin, or resveratrol can indeed extend lifespan. 
Finally, we each describe our supplement regimens and compare the role of supplementation to behaviors such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise for longevity. We also discuss whether tests of biological age are true indicators of aging and whether normal radiation levels increase cancer risk. 
Listeners of this episode will learn if supplements purported to improve lifespan show any efficacy and the behaviors and other factors that can prevent disease and extend lifespan.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine-trained physician expert in improving human healthspan and lifespan. Dr. Attia is also the host of The Drive podcast and author of the best-selling book Outlive. 
We discuss the NAD pathway in human cells and its possible links to aging and health. We evaluate how supplementation can augment molecules in the NAD pathway; we compare NAD, NMN, and NR, different routes of administration, their safety, and bioavailability. Then, we discuss the broader research and clinical literature on longevity to decide if supplementation with NAD, NR, NMN, rapamycin, or resveratrol can indeed extend lifespan. 
Finally, we each describe our supplement regimens and compare the role of supplementation to behaviors such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise for longevity. We also discuss whether tests of biological age are true indicators of aging and whether normal radiation levels increase cancer risk. 
Listeners of this episode will learn if supplements purported to improve lifespan show any efficacy and the behaviors and other factors that can prevent disease and extend lifespan.

      <title>Dr. Stacy Sims: Female-Specific Exercise &amp; Nutrition for Health, Performance &amp; Longevity</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-stacy-sims-female-specific-exercise-nutrition-for-health-performance-longevity</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Stacy Sims, Ph.D., an exercise physiologist, nutrition scientist, and expert in female-specific nutrition and training for health, performance, and longevity. We discuss which exercise and nutrition protocols are ideal for women based on their age and particular goals.
We discuss whether women should train fasted, when and what to eat pre- and post-training, and how the menstrual cycle impacts training and nutrition needs. We also explain how to use a combination of resistance, high-intensity, and sprint interval training to effectively improve body composition, hormones, and cardiometabolic health, offset cognitive decline, and promote longevity. 
We also discuss supplements and caffeine, the unique sleep needs of women based on age, whether women should use deliberate cold exposure, and how saunas can improve symptoms of hot flashes and benefit athletic performance. Dr. Sims challenges common misconceptions about women’s health and fitness and explains why certain types of cardio, caloric restriction, and low-protein diets can be harmful to women’s metabolic health.
Listeners will learn a wealth of actionable information on how to improve their training and nutrition to enhance their health and how to age with greater ability, mobility, and vitality.

      <title>Dr. Stuart McGill: Build a Strong, Pain-Proof Back</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-stuart-mcgill-build-a-strong-pain-proof-back</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Stuart McGill, Ph.D., a distinguished professor emeritus of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo and a world expert on spine anatomy and physiology, back pain, and rehabilitation. We discuss the most common sources of back pain, how back pain can be assessed (including self-assessment techniques), and how to design a personalized recovery plan to reduce back pain.
We discuss how to train for lifelong fitness, reduce injury risk, and protect your back and joints based on your age and personal goals. We also discuss how to prevent back pain, build core stability, and explain how “McGill’s Big 3” exercises protect and strengthen the back. Dr. McGill, who is exceptionally fit in his late 60s, describes his low-time investment, personal training routine, and the specific exercises he uses for mobility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness.
We also discuss controversial issues in the back pain and rehabilitation field, including how pain originates, the biopsychosocial model of pain, and treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This episode provides clear, actionable tools to strengthen, prevent, and remedy back pain and injury so you can be pain-free while enjoying sports, exercise, and daily activities at any age.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Stuart McGill, Ph.D., a distinguished professor emeritus of spine biomechanics at the University of Waterloo and a world expert on spine anatomy and physiology, back pain, and rehabilitation. We discuss the most common sources of back pain, how back pain can be assessed (including self-assessment techniques), and how to design a personalized recovery plan to reduce back pain.
We discuss how to train for lifelong fitness, reduce injury risk, and protect your back and joints based on your age and personal goals. We also discuss how to prevent back pain, build core stability, and explain how “McGill’s Big 3” exercises protect and strengthen the back. Dr. McGill, who is exceptionally fit in his late 60s, describes his low-time investment, personal training routine, and the specific exercises he uses for mobility, strength, and cardiovascular fitness.
We also discuss controversial issues in the back pain and rehabilitation field, including how pain originates, the biopsychosocial model of pain, and treatments such as platelet-rich plasma (PRP). This episode provides clear, actionable tools to strengthen, prevent, and remedy back pain and injury so you can be pain-free while enjoying sports, exercise, and daily activities at any age.

      <title>Dr. Matthew Hill: How Cannabis Impacts Health &amp; the Potential Risks</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-matthew-hill-how-cannabis-impacts-health-the-potential-risks</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Matthew Hill, Ph.D., a professor of cell biology and anatomy at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary and an expert on the biology of cannabis. We discuss how cannabis affects the brain to produce its psychoactive effects (feeling “high”), including altered time perception, focus, memory, appetite, and stress.
We discuss how THC vs. cannabidiol (CBD) affects the brain, the effects of different routes of cannabis administration (e.g., smoking, vaping, edibles), high-potency THC, and whether cannabis is addictive. We discuss if there is a link between cannabis use and the development of psychosis, anxiety, bipolar depression, or schizophrenia. 
We discuss whether CBD has clinical benefits in regulating stress, promoting sleep, and treating certain diseases. We also discuss if there are real and consistent differences in the biological effects of different cannabis strains, if cannabis impacts hormones, and the uses of cannabis for the management of pain, stress, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and nausea.
Listeners of this episode will get an up-to-date understanding of what is currently known about how cannabis affects the brain and body, including both its potential benefits and risks.

      <title>How to Improve Skin Health &amp; Appearance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-improve-skin-health-appearance</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss skin health and appearance and why both are important indicators of the health status of your immune system, gut microbiome, and other organ systems. I explain why sunlight is essential for skin and hormone health and how excessive sunlight can accelerate skin aging and cause certain skin cancers. I discuss the different types of sunscreens (physical, chemical, and mineral-based) and potential health concerns of the chemicals found in some (but not all) sunscreens.
I also discuss the importance of getting your skin (and not just moles) checked for pre-cancerous and cancer growths, the role of nutrition and lifestyle factors that improve skin health and appearance, and how to improve your skin by reducing local and systemic inflammation and supporting your microbiome. 
I explain what works to improve your skin's youthfulness and appearance, including reducing wrinkles, sagging, and pore size. I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.
I also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions.
This episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I discuss skin health and appearance and why both are important indicators of the health status of your immune system, gut microbiome, and other organ systems. I explain why sunlight is essential for skin and hormone health and how excessive sunlight can accelerate skin aging and cause certain skin cancers. I discuss the different types of sunscreens (physical, chemical, and mineral-based) and potential health concerns of the chemicals found in some (but not all) sunscreens.
I also discuss the importance of getting your skin (and not just moles) checked for pre-cancerous and cancer growths, the role of nutrition and lifestyle factors that improve skin health and appearance, and how to improve your skin by reducing local and systemic inflammation and supporting your microbiome. 
I explain what works to improve your skin's youthfulness and appearance, including reducing wrinkles, sagging, and pore size. I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.
I also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions.
This episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.

      <title>Dr. Gabrielle Lyon: How to Exercise &amp; Eat for Optimal Health &amp; Longevity</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-gabrielle-lyon-how-to-exercise-eat-for-optimal-health-longevity</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, D.O., a board-certified physician who did her clinical and research training at Washington University in geriatrics and nutrition. She is also an expert in how diet and exercise impact muscle and whole-body health and longevity. Dr. Lyon is a bestselling author and public educator. We discuss how healthy skeletal muscle promotes longevity, brain health, disease prevention, ideal body composition, and the health of other organs and bodily systems.
She makes specific nutritional recommendations for optimal health: what to eat, how much to eat, the timing of meals, the essential need for adequate quality protein (including animal and plant-based options), supplementation, and how our dietary requirements change with age. She explains why specific types of resistance training are essential to build and maintain muscle and overall metabolic health. She also describes how to include resistance training as part of your exercise regimen — regardless of age or sex. 
She also provides specific mindset tools to encourage sustained adherence to healthy eating and exercise practices. Women and men of all ages will benefit from Dr. Lyon’s practical, evidence-based protocols to improve muscle and whole-body appearance, function, and health.

      <title>Dr. Zachary Knight: The Science of Hunger &amp; Medications to Combat Obesity</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-zachary-knight-the-science-of-hunger-medications-to-combat-obesity</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Zachary Knight, Ph.D., a professor of physiology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. We discuss how the brain controls our sense of hunger, satiety, and thirst. He explains how dopamine levels impact our cravings and eating behavior (amount, food choices, etc) and how we develop and can change our food preferences and adjust how much we need to eat to feel satisfied.
We discuss factors that have led to the recent rise in obesity, such as interactions between our genes and the environment and the role of processed foods and food combinations. We also discuss the new class of medications developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, including the GLP-1 agonists semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). We discuss how these medications work to promote weight loss, the source of their side effects, and the newer compounds soon to overcome some of those side effects, such as muscle loss.
Dr. Knight provides an exceptionally clear explanation for our sense of hunger, thirst, and food cravings that translates to practical knowledge to help listeners better understand their relationship to food, food choices, and meal size to improve their diet and overall health.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Zachary Knight, Ph.D., a professor of physiology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator. We discuss how the brain controls our sense of hunger, satiety, and thirst. He explains how dopamine levels impact our cravings and eating behavior (amount, food choices, etc) and how we develop and can change our food preferences and adjust how much we need to eat to feel satisfied.
We discuss factors that have led to the recent rise in obesity, such as interactions between our genes and the environment and the role of processed foods and food combinations. We also discuss the new class of medications developed for the treatment of obesity and diabetes, including the GLP-1 agonists semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro). We discuss how these medications work to promote weight loss, the source of their side effects, and the newer compounds soon to overcome some of those side effects, such as muscle loss.
Dr. Knight provides an exceptionally clear explanation for our sense of hunger, thirst, and food cravings that translates to practical knowledge to help listeners better understand their relationship to food, food choices, and meal size to improve their diet and overall health.

      <title>Dr. Jonathan Haidt: How Smartphones &amp; Social Media Impact Mental Health &amp; the Realistic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-jonathan-haidt-how-smartphones-social-media-impact-mental-health-the-realistic-solutions</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jonathan Haidt, Ph.D., professor of social psychology at New York University and bestselling author on how technology and culture impact the psychology and health of kids, teens, and adults. We discuss the dramatic rise of suicide, depression, and anxiety as a result of replacing a play-based childhood with smartphones, social media, and video games.
He explains how a screen-filled childhood leads to challenges in psychological development that negatively impact learning, resilience, identity, cooperation, and conflict resolution — all of which are crucial skills for future adult relationships and career success. We also discuss how phones and social media impact boys and girls differently and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of how smartphones alter basic brain plasticity and function. 
Dr. Haidt explains his four recommendations for healthier smartphone use in kids, and we discuss how to restore childhood independence and play in the current generation. 
This is an important topic for everyone, young or old, parents and teachers, students and families, to be aware of in order to understand the potential mental health toll of smartphone use and to apply tools to foster skill-building and reestablish healthy norms for our kids.

      <title>Dr. Mary Claire Haver: How to Navigate Menopause &amp; Perimenopause for Maximum Health &amp; Vitality</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-mary-claire-haver-how-to-navigate-menopause-perimenopause-for-maximum-health-vitality</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Mary Claire Haver, M.D., a board-certified OB/GYN and an expert on women’s health and menopause. We discuss the biology and symptoms of perimenopause and menopause and their effects on body composition, cardiometabolic health, mental health, and longevity. She explains the lifestyle factors, including nutrition, resistance training, sleep, and supplements, that can better prepare women for and improve symptoms of both perimenopause and menopause. We also discuss hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whether HRT impacts the incidence of breast cancer or can affect cardiovascular health.
We also discuss contraception, cellulite, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and how to reduce the risk of osteoporosis. This episode is rich in actionable information related to what is known about menopause and perimenopause and the stages before, allowing women of all ages to best navigate these life stages.

      <title>Dr. Diego Bohórquez: The Science of Your Gut Sense &amp; the Gut-Brain Axis </title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-diego-bohorquez-the-science-of-your-gut-sense-the-gut-brain-axis</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Diego Bohórquez, PhD, professor of medicine and neurobiology at Duke University and a pioneering researcher into how we use our ‘gut sense.’ He describes how your gut communicates to your brain and the rest of your body through hormones and neural connections to shape your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. He explains how your gut senses a range of features such as temperature, pH, the macro- and micronutrients in our foods, and much more and signals that information to the brain to affect our food preferences, aversions, and cravings.
Dr. Bohórquez describes his early life in the Amazon jungle and how exposure to traditional agriculture inspired his unique expertise combining nutrition, gastrointestinal physiology, and neuroscience. We discuss how the gut and brain integrate sensory cues, leading to our intuitive “gut sense” about food, people, and situations. This episode provides a scientific perspective into your gut sense to help you make better food choices and, indeed, to support better decision-making in all of life.

This episode provides a scientific perspective into your gut sense to help you make better food choices and, indeed, to support better decision-making in all of life.</p><p>For show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-diego-bohorquez-the-science-of-your-gut-sense-the-gut-brain-axis">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://drinkag1.com/partner/huberman/ctr?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=partnerships&amp;utm_campaign=drhuberman_d35ct__a1294__o56&amp;utm_term=variable__a1294__o56&amp;utm_content=7-Health-Wellness__a1294__o56">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>Joovv: <a href="https://joovv.com/pages/andrew-huberman?afmc=1g1&amp;utm_campaign=1g1&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=leaddyno">https://joovv.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://partners.drinklmnt.com/free-gift-with-purchase?utm_campaign=agwp&amp;rfsn=6327528.ecaabe8&amp;utm_medium=sponsor&amp;utm_source=andrewhuberman&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=&amp;rfsn_cn=EXCLUSIVE+GIFT+FOR+THE+HUBERMAN+LAB+COMMUNITY">https://drinklmnt.com/huberman</a></p><p>Helix Sleep: <a href="https://go.helixsleep.com/audio-partner/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=audio&amp;utm_campaign=huberman">https://helixsleep.com/huberman</a></p><p>InsideTracker: <a href="https://info.insidetracker.com/huberman">https://insidetracker.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Dr. Diego Bohórquez</p><p>00:02:37 Sponsors: Joovv, LMNT &amp; Helix Sleep; YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Subscribe</p><p>00:06:49 Gut-Brain Axis</p><p>00:11:35 Gut Sensing, Hormones</p><p>00:15:26 Green Fluorescent Protein; Neuropod Cells &amp; Environment Sensing</p><p>00:26:57 Brain &amp; Gut Connection, Experimental Tools &amp; Rabies Virus</p><p>00:35:28 Sponsor: AG1</p><p>00:37:00 Neuropod Cells &amp; Nutrient Sensing</p><p>00:43:55 Gastric Bypass Surgery, Cravings &amp; Food Choice</p><p>00:51:14 Optogenetics; Sugar Preference &amp; Neuropod Cells</p><p>01:00:29 Gut-Brain Disorders, Irritable Bowel Syndrome</p><p>01:03:03 Sponsor: InsideTracker</p><p>01:04:04 Gut &amp; Behavior; Gastric Bypass, Cravings &amp; Alcohol</p><p>01:07:38 GLP-1, Ozempic, Neuropod Cells</p><p>01:11:46 Food Preference &amp; Gut-Brain Axis, Protein</p><p>01:21:35 Protein &amp; Sugar, Agriculture &amp; ‘Three Sisters’</p><p>01:25:16 Childhood, Military School; Academics, Nutrition &amp; Nervous System</p><p>01:36:15 Plant Wisdom, Agriculture, Indigenous People</p><p>01:41:48 Evolution of Food Choices; Learning from Plants</p><p>01:48:15 Plant-Based Medicines; Amazonia, Guayusa Ritual &amp; Chonta Palm</p><p>01:56:58 Yerba Mate, Chocolate, Guayusa</p><p>02:00:22 Brain, Gut &amp; Sensory Integration; Variability</p><p>02:06:01 Electrical Patterns in Gut &amp; Brain, “Hangry”</p><p>02:12:43 Gut Intuition, Food &amp; Bonding; Subconscious &amp; Superstition</p><p>02:22:00 Vagus Nerve &amp; Learning, Humming</p><p>02:26:46 Digestive System &amp; Memory; Body Sensing</p><p>02:32:51 Listening to the Body, Meditation</p><p>02:40:12 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Gary Steinberg: How to Improve Brain Health &amp; Offset Neurodegeneration</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-gary-steinberg-how-to-improve-brain-health-offset-neurodegeneration</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Gary Steinberg, MD, PhD, a neurosurgeon and a professor of neurosciences, neurosurgery, and neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine. We discuss brain health and brain injuries, including concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, aneurysm, and transient ischemic attacks (TIA). We discuss key and lesser-known risk factors for brain health and explain how certain treatments and medications can improve brain health and cognitive function. 
We also cover novel mechanisms to improve recovery after concussions and brain injury, including the use of stem cells, temperature (mild hypothermia), and vagus nerve stimulation. Dr. Steinberg also describes new advances in neurosurgery and minimally invasive brain augmentation.
This episode ought to be of interest to anyone seeking actionable tools to improve their brain health and for those seeking to improve recovery after a brain injury such as concussion, stroke, aneurysm, or TBI.

      <title>Dr. James Hollis: How to Find Your True Purpose &amp; Create Your Best Life</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-james-hollis-how-to-find-your-true-purpose-create-your-best-life</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. James Hollis, Ph.D., a Jungian psychoanalyst, renowned educator and author on finding and pursuing one’s unique purpose. Dr. Hollis is also an expert in the psychology of relationships and healing from trauma. We discuss how early family dynamics and social context create patterns of both adaptive and maladaptive behavior and internal narratives that, when examined, lead to better choices and a deeply fulfilling existence.
We discuss discovering your unique self-identity and purpose through specific practices of reflection, meditation and conversations with others. We also discuss self-perception and the evolution of roles within marriages, parent-child relationships, and work.
Throughout the episode, Dr. Hollis provides both basic knowledge and practical tools to help us assess ourselves and better understand who we are and what we really want in careers, relationships of all kinds, and society.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Dr. James Hollis, Ph.D., a Jungian psychoanalyst, renowned educator and author on finding and pursuing one’s unique purpose. Dr. Hollis is also an expert in the psychology of relationships and healing from trauma. We discuss how early family dynamics and social context create patterns of both adaptive and maladaptive behavior and internal narratives that, when examined, lead to better choices and a deeply fulfilling existence.
We discuss discovering your unique self-identity and purpose through specific practices of reflection, meditation and conversations with others. We also discuss self-perception and the evolution of roles within marriages, parent-child relationships, and work.
Throughout the episode, Dr. Hollis provides both basic knowledge and practical tools to help us assess ourselves and better understand who we are and what we really want in careers, relationships of all kinds, and society.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: The Science of Dreams, Nightmares &amp; Lucid Dreaming</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-matt-walker-the-science-of-dreams-nightmares-lucid-dreaming</link>
      <description>This is episode 6 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and a leading public educator on sleep for mental and physical health, learning and human performance. In this episode, we discuss dreaming, including the biological mechanism of dreams, what dreams mean and their role in daytime life. 
We explore how dreams can enhance our creativity and emotional well-being and help us resolve various challenges and dilemmas. We discuss how to remember and interpret your dreams and the abstractions/symbols frequently present in dreams.
We also discuss nightmares and therapies to treat reoccurring nightmares. We explain what lucid dreaming is and if there are benefits or drawbacks to this type of dreaming.
Dr. Walker also answers frequently asked audience questions and discusses snoring, body position, sleep supplements, sleep challenges due to aging, menopause, stopping racing thoughts, and how to fall back asleep if you wake in the middle of the night.

      <title>Dr. Casey Means: Transform Your Health by Improving Metabolism, Hormone &amp; Blood Sugar Regulation</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-casey-means-transform-your-health-by-improving-metabolism-hormone-blood-sugar-regulation</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Casey Means, M.D., a physician trained at Stanford University School of Medicine, an expert on metabolic health and the author of the book, "Good Energy." We discuss how to leverage nutrition, exercise and environmental factors to enhance your metabolic health by improving mitochondrial function, hormone and blood sugar regulation. 
We also explore how fasting, deliberate cold exposure and spending time in nature can impact metabolic health, how to control food cravings and how to assess your metabolic health using blood testing, continuous glucose monitors and other tools. 
Metabolic dysfunction is a leading cause of chronic disease, obesity and reduced lifespan around the world. Conversely, improving your mitochondrial and metabolic health can positively affect your health span and longevity.
Listeners of this episode will learn low- and zero-cost tools to improve their metabolic health, physical and mental well-being, body composition and target the root cause of various common diseases.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: Improve Sleep to Boost Mood &amp; Emotional Regulation</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-matt-walker-improve-sleep-to-boost-mood-emotional-regulation</link>
      <description>This is episode 5 of our 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and the host of The Matt Walker Podcast. In this episode, we explain the connection between sleep and mood, emotional regulation and mental well-being. 
We explain the role of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in processing emotions and emotional memories and why sleep deprivation causes agitation, impulsivity and emotional reactivity. 
We also discuss why sleep disruption is a hallmark feature of PTSD, anxiety, depression, suicidality, and other psychiatric conditions. 
We explain protocols for improving REM sleep and other sleep phases in order to harness the therapeutic power of quality sleep to feel calmer and emotionally restored.
This episode describes various actionable tools to improve sleep for those struggling with mental health or mood and those wanting to bolster their overall state and well-being. 
The next episode in this special series explores dreams, including lucid dreaming, nightmares and dream interpretation.

      <title>AMA #17: Making Time for Fitness, Top Sleep Tools &amp; Best Learning Strategies</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the 17th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium.
Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation. Read our Annual Letter 2023.
If you're an existing Premium member, you can login to access the full episode.
If you're not a member, you can join Huberman Lab Premium to enjoy exclusive content, including monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and help advance human scientific research.

      <title>Protocols to Strengthen &amp; Pain Proof Your Back</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/protocols-to-strengthen-pain-proof-your-back</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how to strengthen and build a stable, pain-free back and how to reduce or eliminate existing back pain. I explain the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord and vertebrae, intervertebral disks and nerve pathways, and the abdominal and back muscles that together can be leveraged to stabilize the back. 
Then, I describe protocols: “McGill’s Big 3” exercises, a highly effective psoas stretch, abdominal stabilization, breathing techniques, and protocols to reinforce essential supports for the back, including the neck, pelvis, feet, and toes. 
I also explain how you can reduce and potentially eliminate back pain and sciatica using a specific type of bar hang, “cobra push-ups,” medial-glute strengthening exercises, and more. 
Back pain greatly impedes one’s ability to enjoy daily activities; this episode provides zero-cost, minimal time-investment protocols to improve your back strength and stability and allow you to move through life pain-free and with ease and mobility.

      <itunes:subtitle>In this episode, I explain how to strengthen and build a stable, pain-free back and how to reduce or eliminate existing back pain.</itunes:subtitle>
      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I explain how to strengthen and build a stable, pain-free back and how to reduce or eliminate existing back pain. I explain the anatomy and physiology of the spinal cord and vertebrae, intervertebral disks and nerve pathways, and the abdominal and back muscles that together can be leveraged to stabilize the back. 
Then, I describe protocols: “McGill’s Big 3” exercises, a highly effective psoas stretch, abdominal stabilization, breathing techniques, and protocols to reinforce essential supports for the back, including the neck, pelvis, feet, and toes. 
I also explain how you can reduce and potentially eliminate back pain and sciatica using a specific type of bar hang, “cobra push-ups,” medial-glute strengthening exercises, and more. 
Back pain greatly impedes one’s ability to enjoy daily activities; this episode provides zero-cost, minimal time-investment protocols to improve your back strength and stability and allow you to move through life pain-free and with ease and mobility.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: Using Sleep to Improve Learning, Creativity &amp; Memory</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-matt-walker-using-sleep-to-improve-learning-creativity-memory</link>
      <description>This is episode 4 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of the best-selling book "Why We Sleep." In this episode, we discuss the relationship between sleep, learning and creativity. 
We explain why and how sleep before and after a learning bout can improve memory and performance for both cognitive tasks and physical skills. We also discuss how to use time learning and sleep, how to use naps, non-sleep deep rest states, and caffeine to optimize learning, and the mechanisms for sleep and memory consolidation. 
We also explain the critical role that sleep plays in creativity and one's ability to discover novel solutions to challenges and problems. 
This episode is filled with actionable information on using sleep to enhance skill learning and improve memory and creativity. 
The next episode in this guest series explains how sleep benefits emotional regulation and mental health.

      <title>Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher: Vaping, Alcohol Use &amp; Other Risky Youth Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-bonnie-halpern-felsher-vaping-alcohol-use-other-risky-youth-behaviors</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, PhD, FSAHM. She is a professor of pediatrics and adolescent medicine and a developmental psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Halpern-Felsher is a world expert in adolescent decision-making and risk-taking behaviors.
She explains the huge increase in vaping (e-cigarettes) by young people. She explains why vaping nicotine and cannabis is particularly dangerous to the developing brain. We discuss the rise in vaping addiction, the unique social pressures and social media influences faced by youth that make quitting challenging, and interventions to aid them in quitting or reducing use.
We also discuss the role of technology and social media. And, the use of alcohol, nicotine pouches, fentanyl, and other risky behaviors that adolescents face now.
This episode should interest parents, teachers, coaches, teens, and families. It covers the current youth substance use landscape and also covers resources and ways to quit these addictive behaviors.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: How to Structure Your Sleep, Use Naps &amp; Time Caffeine</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-matt-walker-how-to-structure-your-sleep-use-naps-time-caffeine</link>
      <description>This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and leading public educator about the role of sleep in health, disease and performance. 
We explain how our sleep architecture changes as we age. We also cover how childhood development and aging affect sleep biology and needs. We also discuss whether polyphasic sleep (multiple short sleep periods) is beneficial. 
Then, we discuss naps, including their positive benefits, individual variability, those who should not nap, and alternative rest states like non-sleep deep rest. Dr. Walker shares protocols to optimize nap duration, timing and effectiveness.
We also explore the effects of caffeine on sleep and other health aspects, as well as the optimal timing for caffeine intake.
This episode describes many actionable science-based tools for optimizing sleep, naps and caffeine use for better health and performance.
The next episode in this special series explores the relationship between sleep, memory, and creativity.

      <title>Dr. David Yeager: How to Master Growth Mindset to Improve Performance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-david-yeager-how-to-master-growth-mindset-to-improve-performance</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Yeager, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and the author of the forthcoming book "10 to 25." We discuss how people of any age can use growth mindset and stress-is-enhancing mindsets to improve motivation and performance.
We explain the best mindset for mentors and being mentored and how great leaders motivate others with high standards and support. We also discuss why a sense of purpose is essential to goal pursuit and achievement.
Whether you are a parent, teacher, boss, coach, student or someone wanting to improve a skill or overcome a particular challenge, this episode provides an essential framework for adopting performance-enhancing mindsets leading to success.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: Protocols to Improve Your Sleep</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-matthew-walker-protocols-to-improve-your-sleep</link>
      <description>This is episode 2 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., a professor of neuroscience and psychology and founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley.
We discuss basic and advanced tools for improving sleep and explain how sleep quality is affected by temperature, light and dark, caffeine, alcohol, cannabis, nutrition, meal timing, and different medications. 
Dr. Walker also provides strategies for coping with a poor night of sleep, wind-down routines, technology in the bedroom, insomnia, visualizations, and building sleep “confidence.” 
We also discuss the current status of sleep research for developing advanced techniques to optimize sleep. 
This episode provides numerous zero-cost behavioral protocols for improving sleep quality and restorative power, which can benefit daytime mood, energy, performance, and overall health. 
The next episode in this special series explores napping, caffeine, and additional protocols to improve sleep.

      <title>Coleman Ruiz: Overcoming Physical &amp; Emotional Challenges</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/coleman-ruiz-overcoming-physical-emotional-challenges</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Coleman Ruiz, a former Tier One U.S. Navy SEAL joint task force commander. He served in Afghanistan and Iraq and as a BUD/S training officer. He shares his journey from childhood through the Naval Academy to elite Navy SEAL special operations. He shares the physical and emotional challenges he has overcome and discusses his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He also talks about the key role of mentors, family and friends in building resilience. Coleman gives us a raw, humble account of hitting rock bottom. He tells of the intense pain, fear, depression and suicidality in his journey of redemption. Coleman’s story is a real-life hero’s journey. He tells it with extraordinary vulnerability and humility. He explains the challenges and sudden tragedies that helped to ground, shape and renew him. His story will inspire listeners of all ages and backgrounds.
Note: This conversation includes profanity and topics that are not suitable for all audiences and ages.

He served in Afghanistan and Iraq and as a BUD/S training officer. He shares his journey from childhood through the Naval Academy to elite Navy SEAL special operations. He shares the physical and emotional challenges he has overcome and discusses his struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He also talks about the key role of mentors, family and friends in building resilience. Coleman gives us a raw, humble account of hitting rock bottom. He tells of the intense pain, fear, depression and suicidality in his journey of redemption. Coleman’s story is a real-life hero’s journey. He tells it with extraordinary vulnerability and humility. He explains the challenges and sudden tragedies that helped to ground, shape and renew him. His story will inspire listeners of all ages and backgrounds.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This conversation includes profanity and topics that are not suitable for all audiences and ages.</p><p>For show notes, including additional resources, please visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/coleman-ruiz-overcoming-physical-emotional-challenges">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><p>Use <a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/8SkJCfDn">Ask Huberman Lab</a>, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Coleman Ruiz</p><p>(00:02:12) Sponsors: LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>(00:06:06) Childhood, “Wildness”</p><p>(00:13:24) Wrestling, Combat Sports &amp; Respect</p><p>(00:22:26) Divorce, College Applications &amp; Naval Academy</p><p>(00:25:59) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:31:22) Prep School, Patriotism, Fear</p><p>(00:40:08) Growth Mindset, 24-Hour Horizon</p><p>(00:43:02) Naval Academy, Mentor, Focus</p><p>(00:52:45) Wife, Work Ethic</p><p>(01:00:51) Navy SEALs, BUD/S, Hell Week</p><p>(01:04:51) BUD/S Success Predictors; Divorce &amp; Aloneness; Rebellion</p><p>(01:16:30) Patriotism, Navy SEALs, Green Team</p><p>(01:22:15) Advanced Training, Tier One, Free-Fall</p><p>(01:26:13) Special Operations, Deaths &amp; Grief</p><p>(01:36:08) Mentor Death &amp; Facing Mortality</p><p>(01:47:49) Warriors &amp; Compassion; Trauma, Family</p><p>(01:52:37) Civilian Life Adjustment</p><p>(01:57:39) Hero With a Thousand Faces, Civilian Return &amp; PTSD</p><p>(02:07:03) Massage, Perspective, Space-Time Bridging</p><p>(02:14:10) Psychedelics, Connection, Warrior Culture</p><p>(02:19:15) Rock Bottom: Talk Therapy, Depression, Alcohol</p><p>(02:25:50) Emotional &amp; Physical Pain, Vulnerability, Fighter Mentality</p><p>(02:30:42) Suicide, Asking For Help &amp; Support</p><p>(02:38:32) Therapy, PTSD Recovery, Dread; Pharmacology</p><p>(02:44:54) Healing Process: Unsatisfaction &amp; Asking For Help</p><p>(02:54:03) Daily Routine, Movement, Nutrition</p><p>(03:02:22) Manhood, Range, Parenthood, Surrender</p><p>(03:10:08) Current Pursuits</p><p>(03:16:01) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Matt Walker: The Biology of Sleep &amp; Your Unique Sleep Needs</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-matthew-walker-the-biology-of-sleep-your-unique-sleep-needs</link>
      <description>In this episode 1 of a 6-part special series on sleep with Dr. Matthew Walker, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience and psychology and founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of the book “Why We Sleep” discusses the essential role that sleep plays in our health. We cover how sleep affects our hormones, immune system, learning and memory, mood, appetite, and weight regulation.
We also discuss what causes the urge to sleep, how sleep is structured throughout the night, and the biology of the different phases of sleep. We also teach you how to determine your individualized sleep needs, including your chronotype (best waking and to-bed time), tips for combat snoring and insomnia, and your QQRT (Quality, Quantity, Regularity, and Timing)—a key framework for optimizing your sleep and therefore daytime energy and focus, and overall health.
The next episode in this special series explores how to improve one’s sleep.

      <title>Benefits &amp; Risks of Peptide Therapeutics for Physical &amp; Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/benefits-risks-of-peptide-therapeutics-for-physical-mental-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the major categories and types of peptides currently in use for therapeutic purposes. I discuss peptides for improving tissue rejuvenation and repair, promoting longevity, improving muscle growth and fat loss, and boosting mood, vitality, and libido. I explain the biology of how these peptides work and both their potential benefits and risks. I also discuss peptide sourcing, dosages, cycling, routes of administration, and how peptides work in combination. 
This episode will help you better understand the rapidly expanding landscape of peptide therapeutics and how to evaluate if specific peptides might be advantageous towards achieving your physical or mental health goals.

      <title>Asi Wind: What Magic &amp; Mind Reading Reveal About the Brain</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/asi-wind-what-magic-mind-reading-reveal-about-the-brain</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Asi Wind. He's one of the world’s top magicians and mentalists. 
We discuss what magic and mentalism reveal about the human mind, including how memories are made, how to erase them, and how and why we perceive things the way we do, all in the context of how he performs his astonishing tricks. 
Asi explains that magic works because it involves storytelling, which is key to how we organize memories. He also explains how emotional connection allows people to co-create and believe a common narrative, even one that did not actually occur. 
We also discuss how Asi's love of painting and photography and his specific daily routine allow him to access creativity. We also discuss fear, perfectionism, and how feeling emotions deeply serves his craft. 
Whether you are interested in magic or not, this conversation with Asi will give you an incredible window into how you perceive, learn, and remember the world around you and how what you believe may or may not be based in reality.

      <title>Dr. E.J. Chichilnisky: How the Brain Works, Curing Blindness &amp; How to Navigate a Career Path</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-ej-chichilnisky-how-the-brain-works-curing-blindness-how-to-navigate-a-career-path</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. E.J. Chichilnisky, Ph.D., a professor of neurosurgery and ophthalmology at Stanford University. He studies how we see and uses that information to build artificial eyes that restore vision to the blind. 
We discuss how understanding the retina (the light-sensing brain tissue that lines the back of our eyes) is critical to knowing how our brain works more generally. 
We discuss brain augmentation with biologically informed prostheses, robotics, and AI and what this means for medicine and humanity. 
We also discuss E.J.’s unique journey into neuroscience and how changing fields multiple times, combined with some wandering, taught him how to guide his decision-making in all realms of life. 
This episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in learning how the brain works from a world-class neuroscientist, those interested in the future of brain therapeutics and people seeking inspiration and tools for navigating their own professional and life journey.

      <title>How Placebo Effects Work to Change Our Biology &amp; Psychology</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-placebo-effects-work-to-change-our-biology-psychology</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss placebo and belief and mindset effects — all of which exert a powerful and real influence on our biology and psychology. I discuss how your beliefs and expectation that a certain outcome will occur after taking a substance (or any intervention cause genuine changes in brain and bodily function. I discuss how placebos can change neurotransmitter and hormone release, pain levels, whether the stress response is beneficial or detrimental and more. I also explain how placebo effects can work with traditional drug or behavioral treatments to help improve health outcomes and why some people are more susceptible to placebo effects. By the end of the episode, listeners will understand the placebo effect, how it works, and how beliefs and mindsets can be leveraged toward mental health, physical health, and performance goals.

      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-16-sleep-vertigo-tbi-ocd-tips-for-travelers-gut-brain-axis-more</link>
      <description>Welcome to a special edition of the 16th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium, recorded in Sydney, Australia. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Premium members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.
Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.
If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023.
If you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here.

      <title>Dr. Becky Kennedy: Protocols for Excellent Parenting &amp; Improving Relationships of All Kinds</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-becky-kennedy-protocols-for-excellent-parenting-improving-relationships-of-all-kinds</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Becky Kennedy, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, bestselling author, and founder of Good Inside, an education platform for parents and parents-to-be. We discuss actionable protocols for raising resilient, emotionally healthy kids and effective alternatives to typical forms of reward and punishment that instead teach children valuable skills and strengthen the parent-child bond. These protocols also apply to other types of relationships: professional, romantic, friendships, siblings, etc. 
We explain how to respond to emotional outbursts, rudeness, and entitlement, repair fractured relationships, build self-confidence, and improve interpersonal connections with empathy while maintaining healthy boundaries. 
We also discuss how to effectively communicate with children and adults with ADHD, anxiety, learning challenges, or with “deeply feeling” individuals. 
The conversation is broadly applicable to all types of social interactions and bonds. By the end of the episode, you will have learned simple yet powerful tools to build healthy relationships with kids, teens, adults, and oneself.

      <title>Dr. Mark D'Esposito: How to Optimize Cognitive Function &amp; Brain Health</title>
      <link>https://www.www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-mark-desposito-how-to-optimize-cognitive-function-brain-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Mark D'Esposito, M.D., a neurologist and professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying cognition and the forms of memory required for focus, productivity, planning and achieving goals, and learning. We discuss neurochemicals such as dopamine and acetylcholine and how they can be leveraged to improve cognitive functioning. We also discuss concussion, traumatic brain injury (TBI), Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease, and ways to restore or slow cognitive decline by using pharmacologic, lifestyle and behavioral protocols. This episode provides a modern understanding of cognition and memory and actionable tools to optimize brain health and function.

      <title>How to Improve Oral Health &amp; Its Critical Role in Brain &amp; Body Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-improve-oral-health-its-critical-role-in-brain-body-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the importance of oral health for dental and microbiome health and general physical and mental well-being. I explain science-supported protocols for strengthening your teeth and gums, including how to remineralize your teeth. I cover the best approaches and timing for brushing and flossing, tongue, gum, and oral microbiome care and how oral health is critically important to offset metabolic, cardiac, and brain diseases, including dementia. I also discuss proper nutrition for oral health, fluoride, and how sugar and mouth breathing can accelerate tooth decay. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone seeking to improve their physical health, mental health, and lifespan, given the critical role that oral health plays in all of these.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I discuss the importance of oral health for dental and microbiome health and general physical and mental well-being. I explain science-supported protocols for strengthening your teeth and gums, including how to remineralize your teeth. I cover the best approaches and timing for brushing and flossing, tongue, gum, and oral microbiome care and how oral health is critically important to offset metabolic, cardiac, and brain diseases, including dementia. I also discuss proper nutrition for oral health, fluoride, and how sugar and mouth breathing can accelerate tooth decay. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone seeking to improve their physical health, mental health, and lifespan, given the critical role that oral health plays in all of these.

      <title>Dr. Kay Tye: The Biology of Social Interactions and Emotions</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-kay-tye-the-biology-of-social-interactions-and-emotions</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Kay Tye, Ph.D., Professor of Systems Neurobiology at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator. We discuss the neural circuit basis of social interactions and loneliness. We also discuss how animals and people establish themselves in a group hierarchy by rank and how the brain responds to dominance and subordination.
Much of our discussion relates to how social media impacts our sense of social connectedness or lack thereof. The topics covered in this episode are directly relevant to anyone interested in the neuroscience of mental health, work-life balance, abundance versus scarcity mindset, and interpersonal dynamics.

      <title>Tools to Enhance Working Memory &amp; Attention</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/tools-to-enhance-working-memory-attention</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss working memory, which is critical for learning and productivity, strategy setting, goal seeking, and navigating new environments. I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.
I also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attention—including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits.
This episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I discuss working memory, which is critical for learning and productivity, strategy setting, goal seeking, and navigating new environments. I explain the key role of dopamine and the biological mechanisms underlying working memory and how working memory differs from both short- and long-term memory.</p><p>I also describe science-supported tools to enhance working memory and attention—including zero- or low-cost behavioral, supplemental and pharmacologic approaches. I include how to assess your working memory and how to use memory tasks to determine your baseline dopamine levels in certain brain circuits.</p><p>This episode provides listeners with highly actionable tools to assess and improve their attention to specific tasks and task-switching capacity and to enhance their overall productivity.</p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="hubermanlab.com">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><p>Use <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/65vln74">Ask Huberman Lab</a>, our chat-based tool, for summaries, clips, and insights from this episode.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/ag1NE">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Working Memory  </p><p>00:01:12 Sponsors: Mateina, BetterHelp &amp; Helix Sleep  </p><p>00:05:00 Short- vs. Long-Term Memory  </p><p>00:09:59 Neuroplasticity  </p><p>00:15:42 Working Memory; Attention &amp; Focus  </p><p>00:20:04 Working Memory Test  </p><p>00:25:35 Sponsor: AG1  </p><p>00:27:02 Brain &amp; Working Memory; Dopamine  </p><p>00:36:13 Working Memory Capacity Test  </p><p>00:44:37 Increasing Dopamine &amp; Working Memory  </p><p>00:49:26 Task Switching, Distractions  </p><p>00:54:42 Sponsor: LMNT  </p><p>00:56:04 Tool: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) &amp; Dopamine  </p><p>01:03:08 Tool: Deliberate Cold Exposure &amp; Dopamine  </p><p>01:11:02 Tool: Working Memory &amp; Binaural Beats  </p><p>01:15:23 Supplements to Increase Dopamine: L-Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens  </p><p>01:22:53 Dopamine Prescriptions, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  </p><p>01:29:12 Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Journal Club with Dr. Peter Attia | Effects of Light &amp; Dark on Mental Health &amp; Treatments for Cancer</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/journal-club-with-dr-peter-attia-effects-of-light-dark-on-mental-health-treatments-for-cancer?utm_campaign=Journal+Club+with+Dr.+Peter+Attia+%7C+Effects+of+Light+%26+Dark+on+Mental+Health+%26+Treatments+for+Cancer&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>In this journal club episode, my guest is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., a Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician focusing on healthspan and lifespan and the host of The Drive podcast.
We each present a peer-reviewed scientific paper chosen because it contains novel, interesting, and actionable data. First, we discuss a paper on how bright light exposure at sunrise and throughout the day and dark exposure at night independently improve mental health and can offset some of the major symptoms of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety. Then, we discuss an article that explores a novel class of immunotherapy treatments to combat cancer. We also discuss some of the new data on low-calorie sweeteners and if they are safe. This episode should be of interest to listeners curious about maximizing their vitality and longevity and to anyone seeking science-supported ways to improve mental health and lifespan.

      <title>Dr. Sean Mackey: Tools to Reduce &amp; Manage Pain</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-sean-mackey-tools-to-reduce-manage-pain?utm_campaign=Dr.+Sean+Mackey%3A+Tools+to+Reduce+%26+Manage+Pain&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Sean Mackey, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Division of Pain Medicine and Professor of Anesthesiology, Perioperative and Pain Medicine and Neurology at Stanford University School of Medicine. His clinical and research efforts focus on using advanced neurosciences, patient outcomes, biomarkers and informatics to treat pain.
We discuss what pain is at the level of the body and mind, pain thresholds, and the various causes of pain. We also discuss effective protocols for controlling and reducing pain, including the use of heat and cold, acupuncture, chiropractic, physical therapy, nutrition, and supplementation.
We also discuss how pain is influenced by our emotions, stress and memories, and practical tools to control one’s psychological perception of pain.
And we discuss pain medications, including the controversial use of opioids and the opioid crisis.
This episode will help people understand, manage, and control their pain as well as the pain of others.

      <title>How to Prevent &amp; Treat Colds &amp; Flu</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-prevent-treat-colds-flu</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biology of the common cold and flu (influenza) and how the immune system combats these infections.
I describe behavior, nutrition and supplementation-based tools supported by peer-reviewed research to enhance immune system function and better combat colds and flu. I also dispel common myths about how the cold and flu are transmitted and when you and those around you are contagious.
I explain if common preventatives and treatments such as vitamin C, zinc, vitamin D and echinacea work. I also highlight other compounds known to reduce contracting and duration of colds and flu. 
I discuss how to use exercise and sauna to bolster the immune response.
This episode will help listeners understand how to reduce the chances of catching a cold or flu and help people recover more quickly from and prevent the spread of colds and flu.
Correction: I misspoke in the episode. A micron is 1/10,000 of a centimeter, not 1,000. Additionally, 1 millimeter equals 1/10 of a centimeter, not 1/100.

      <title>David Goggins: How to Build Immense Inner Strength</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/david-goggins-how-to-build-immense-inner-strength</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is David Goggins, retired Navy SEAL, highly accomplished ultramarathoner, best-selling author, and influential public speaker.
David explains how he mastered his inner dialogue to build extraordinary levels of discipline and mental and physical toughness.
He describes how confronting his early hardships, including physical and mental abuse, learning disorders, and obesity, became a practice of deep and excruciating self-reflection — eventually allowing him to transmute those experiences into a superhuman work ethic.
This conversation is a unique window into David Goggins’ process in that it focuses both on the underlying science and how David manages and directs his inner dialogue.
It’s a conversation that will inform and inspire anyone wondering how exactly to go about building discipline and confidence and reach their potential.
Note: This conversation includes profanity. Some content might not be suitable for all audiences and ages.

      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ama-14-2023-philanthropy-evening-routine-light-therapy-health-metrics-more</link>
      <description>Welcome to a special edition of the 14th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium. This episode is a recording of a live stream AMA, originally exclusive to our Annual and Lifetime Members. We've decided to make the full-length version available to everyone, including non-members of Huberman Lab Premium.
Huberman Lab Premium was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the main Huberman Lab podcast — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.
If you're not yet a member but enjoyed this full-length livestream AMA, we invite you to join Huberman Lab Premium. By subscribing, you'll gain access to exclusive benefits including our regular monthly full-length AMA episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and more. Additionally, a significant portion of your membership proceeds contributes to advancing human scientific research. You can learn more about the research we were able to support in our Annual Letter 2023.
If you're a Huberman Lab Premium member, you can access the transcript for this AMA episode here.

      <description>In this episode, my guest is Rick Rubin, world-renowned music producer of numerous award-winning artists, including Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beastie Boys, Adele, Eminem, Slayer, and many more. Rick is also the host of the podcast Tetragrammaton and the author of the best-selling book about the creative process entitled “The Creative Act: A Way of Being.” In this Q&amp;A episode, Rick explains the practical aspects of the creative process, such as specific morning and daily routines, the role of movement, and how to source and capture ideas, interpret dreams, and generate work-life balance. He also offers advice for those struggling with creative or motivation blocks.

      <title>Dr. Robert Lustig: How Sugar &amp; Processed Foods Impact Your Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-lustig-how-sugar-processed-foods-impact-your-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health. We address the “calories in- calories out” (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Robert Lustig, M.D., neuroendocrinologist, professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and a bestselling author on nutrition and metabolic health. We address the “calories in- calories out” (CICO) model of metabolism and weight regulation and how specific macronutrients (protein, fat, carbohydrates), fiber and sugar can modify the CICO equation. We cover how different types of sugars, specifically fructose, sugars found in liquid form, taste intensity, and other factors impact insulin levels, liver, kidney, and metabolic health. We also explore how fructose in non-fruit sources can be addictive (acting similarly to drugs of abuse) and how sugar alters brain circuits related to food cravings and satisfaction. We discuss the role of sugar in childhood and adult obesity, gut health and disease and mental health. We also discuss how the food industry uses refined sugars to create pseudo foods and what these do to the brain and body. This episode is replete with actionable information about sugar and metabolism, weight control, brain health and body composition. It ought to be of interest to anyone seeking to understand how specific food choices impact the immediate and long-term health of the brain and body.

      <title>Dr. Karen Parker: The Causes &amp; Treatments for Autism</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-karen-parker-the-causes-treatments-for-autism</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Karen Parker, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry and director of the Social Neurosciences Research Program at Stanford University School of Medicine. We discuss the biology of social connections and bonding in babies, children and adults. Dr. Parker explains our current understanding of autism and autism spectrum disorders: what they are, why the incidence of autism has increased so dramatically in recent years and both the current and emerging treatments for autism. We also discuss the condition formerly called “Asperger’s.” This episode ought to be highly relevant for anyone interested in child and human development, how social bonds form, and to those curious about autism and other spectrum conditions.

      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/robert-greene-a-process-for-finding-achieving-your-unique-purpose</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Robert Greene, multiple New York Times bestselling author and expert on human psychology and behavior both at the individual and group levels and in the context of relationships, careers, and society. We discuss how to find, pursue and achieve one’s unique life purpose, and how to best learn from good and hard experiences along that journey. We discuss power dynamics in relationships, the different types of human communication and the interplay between seduction and vulnerability. We discuss how to find the right romantic partner, improve healthy self-awareness, the link between anxiety and creativity, and pick ideal mentors and role models. Robert also discusses his recent stroke and what he has learned from his near-death experience about motivation, urgency and appreciation for life. Listeners of all ages will benefit from Robert’s insights on navigating the process of building a deeply purposeful life and enhancing one’s relationship with the self, others and society.

      <title>Dr. Adam Grant: How to Unlock Your Potential, Motivation &amp; Unique Abilities</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-adam-grant-how-to-unlock-your-potential-motivation-unique-abilities</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Adam Grant, Ph.D., a professor of organizational psychology at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert in the science and practical steps for increasing motivation, maximizing and reaching our potential, and understanding how individuals and groups can best flourish. He is also an avid public educator, having written five bestselling books, delivered several top-ranking TED Talks and is the host of two psychology podcasts. We discuss how to overcome procrastination, how to increase intrinsic motivation (even for dreaded tasks), identify blind spots and rethink our assumptions, and how we can build a persistent growth mindset. We also explain tools to improve creativity and discuss the surprising relationship between creativity and procrastination. We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.

We then explore how to effectively solicit useful feedback and grow from constructive criticism and how you can improve your level of focus and attention using science-supported methods. We also discuss mental tools to get out of negative thought spirals, how to nurture potential in yourself or others, and the dark side of perfectionism. The discussion delivers more than a dozen science-supported protocols that are readily applicable to anyone seeking to live a more productive, fulfilling, and creative life.

      <title>A Science-Supported Journaling Protocol to Improve Mental &amp; Physical Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/a-science-supported-journaling-protocol-to-improve-mental-physical-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain a specific writing protocol shown in hundreds of scientific studies to significantly improve immediate and long-term health. I explain how to implement this specific protocol, which takes only four days and 15-30 minutes per day. I also explain the mechanism for how the four-day writing protocol affects neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) and brain function in the short and long term. I explain how these brain changes positively impact our physical health, including our system's immune function and thus our ability to combat infections, improve sleep, reduce feelings of physical and emotional pain, lower anxiety, and bring about healing from traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone seeking better mental and/or physical health through the use of brief yet highly effective science-supported protocols.

      <title>LIVE EVENT Q&amp;A: Dr. Andrew Huberman at Meridian Hall in Toronto</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/events</link>
      <description>Recently I had the pleasure of hosting a live event in Toronto, Ontario. This event was part of a lecture series called The Brain Body Contract. My favorite part of the evening was the question &amp; answer period, where I had the opportunity to answer questions from the attendees of each event. Included here is the Q&amp;A from our event at Meridian Hall.
We'll be hosting four live events in Australia in February 2024. Limited tickets remain for our show in Melbourne on February 10, 2024, and Brisbane on February 24, 2024. Our show in Sydney at the Sydney Opera House sold out quickly, so we've added a second show at the Aware Super Theatre on February 18, 2024.

      <title>Dr. Natalie Crawford: Female Hormone Health, Fertility &amp; Vitality</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-natalie-crawford-female-hormone-health-fertility-vitality</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Natalie Crawford, MD, a double board-certified physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, fertility and reproductive health and host of the “As a Woman” podcast. We discuss female hormones, nutrition, supplementation, reproductive health, and fertility, including how the timing and duration of puberty impact a woman’s long-term hormone cycles and menopause. We also discuss the pros and cons of various birth control methods and how hormonal vs. non-hormonal birth control each affects fertility. We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Natalie Crawford, MD, a double board-certified physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology, fertility and reproductive health and host of the “As a Woman” podcast. We discuss female hormones, nutrition, supplementation, reproductive health, and fertility, including how the timing and duration of puberty impact a woman’s long-term hormone cycles and menopause. We also discuss the pros and cons of various birth control methods and how hormonal vs. non-hormonal birth control each affects fertility. We cover the factors that impact egg and sperm quality and how to leverage timing for conception. We also discuss procedures to assess female fertility, including egg count and hormone testing, the process of egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other reproductive options. This episode represents fairly comprehensive coverage of female hormones and reproductive health, highlighting important tests and screening, behavioral, nutritional, supplement and prescription-based tools that women of any age can use to improve their fertility, hormone function and overall health.

      <title>Dr. Michael Eisenberg: Improving Male Sexual Health, Function &amp; Fertility </title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-michael-eisenberg-improving-male-sexual-health-function-fertility</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Michael Eisenberg, MD, a urologist and professor specializing in male sexual function and fertility at Stanford University. Based on his clinical work and research, he is considered a top world expert on male sexual and reproductive health. We discuss testosterone levels and what really impacts them, testosterone therapy, sperm quality and counts, penile and testicular health and function, pelvic floor and prostate and urinary tract health, erectile function and dysfunction and the various causes and treatments for common male sexual, hormonal and reproductive challenges. We also address post-finasteride syndrome and trends in penile length. This episode is rich in actionable information about men’s sexual and reproductive health, including key tests and at-home evaluations, and the behavioral, nutritional, exercise and prescription-based tools that can support male sexual and reproductive health.

      <title>AMA #12: Thoughts on Longevity Supplements (Resveratrol, NR, NMN, Etc.) &amp; How to Improve Memory</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/ama-12-thoughts-on-longevity-supplements-how-to-improve-memory</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the 12th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.
If you're an existing Premium member, you can login to access the full episode.
If you're not a member, you can join Huberman Lab Premium to enjoy exclusive content, including monthly Ask Me Anything (AMA) episodes, AMA transcripts, podcast episode transcripts, early access to live events and help advance human scientific research.

      <title>Mental Health Toolkit: Tools to Bolster Your Mood &amp; Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/mental-health-toolkit-tools-to-bolster-your-mood-mental-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, I provide science-based tools and protocols to improve mood and mental health. These tools represent key takeaways from several recently published research studies, as well as from former Huberman Lab guests Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., an expert in the science of emotions, and Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist with vast clinical expertise in helping people overcome mental health challenges. I explain the first principles of self-care, which include the “Big 6” core pillars for mood and mental health. Those ensure our physiology is primed for our overall feelings of well-being. Then, I explain science-based tools to directly increase confidence, build a stronger concept of self, better understand our unconscious mind, manage stress and improve our emotional tone and processing. I also explain ways to better process negative emotions and traumas. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone wishing to improve their relationship with themselves and others, elevate their mood and mental health, and better contribute to the world in meaningful ways.

      <title>Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett: How to Understand Emotions</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-lisa-feldman-barrett-how-to-understand-emotions</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., a Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University who is a world expert in the science of emotions. She explains what emotions are and how the brain represents and integrates signals from our body and the environment around us to create our unique emotional states. We discuss the relationship between emotions and language, how our specificity of language impacts our emotional processing, the role of facial expressions in emotions, and how emotions relate to sleep, movement, nutrition and the building and reinforcement of social bonds. We also discuss actionable tools for how to regulate feelings of uncertainty and tools to better understand the emotional states of others. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone curious about the neuroscience and psychology underlying emotions and for those who seek to better understand themselves and relate to others and the world in richer, more adaptive ways.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett, Ph.D., a Distinguished Professor of Psychology at Northeastern University who is a world expert in the science of emotions. She explains what emotions are and how the brain represents and integrates signals from our body and the environment around us to create our unique emotional states. We discuss the relationship between emotions and language, how our specificity of language impacts our emotional processing, the role of facial expressions in emotions, and how emotions relate to sleep, movement, nutrition and the building and reinforcement of social bonds. We also discuss actionable tools for how to regulate feelings of uncertainty and tools to better understand the emotional states of others. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone curious about the neuroscience and psychology underlying emotions and for those who seek to better understand themselves and relate to others and the world in richer, more adaptive ways.

      <title>How to Increase Your Willpower &amp; Tenacity</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-increase-your-willpower-and-tenacity</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss neuroscience and psychology studies that address the basis of willpower and tenacity, how they differ from motivation and how we can all increase our levels of willpower and tenacity. I discuss whether willpower is a limited resource, the controversial “ego depletion” theory of willpower and the role that beliefs play in determining our tenacity and willpower. Then, I discuss the neural basis of willpower in the brain and body and how tenacity and willpower relate to sleep, stress, focus, and possibly lifespan. Then, I provide a series of science-supported tools and protocols to increase your level of tenacity and willpower.

      <title>Chris Voss: How to Succeed at Hard Conversations</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/chris-voss-how-to-succeed-at-hard-conversations</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Chris Voss, a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who was the lead negotiator in many high-risk, high-consequence cases. Chris has taught negotiation courses at Harvard and Georgetown Universities and is the author of the book “Never Split the Difference.” We discuss how to navigate difficult conversations of all kinds, including in business, romance and romantic breakups, job firings and tense conversations with family and friends. Chris explains how to navigate online, in person and in written negotiations, the red flags to watch out for and how to read body and voice cues in face-to-face and phone conversations. He explains how to use empathy, certain key questions, proactive listening, emotional processing and more to ensure you reach the best possible outcome in any hard conversation. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone looking to improve their interpersonal abilities and communication skills and for those who want to be able to keep a level head in heated discussions.

      <description>Welcome to a preview of the 11th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: Tools and Protocols for Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-tools-and-protocols-for-mental-health</link>
      <description>This is episode 4 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D. Dr. Conti explains what true self-care is and how our mental health benefits from specific self-care and introspection practices — much in the same way that our physical health benefits from certain exercise and nutrition habits. He describes how the foundation of mental health is an understanding of one’s own mind and the specific questions to ask in order to explore the conscious and unconscious parts of ourselves. He describes how this process can be done either on our own, through journaling, meditation and structured thought, or in therapy with the help of a licensed professional. He also explains how unprocessed trauma can short-circuit the process and how to prevent that, and the role of friendships and other relational support systems in the journey of self-exploration for mental health. People of all ages and those with and without self-introspection and therapy experience ought to benefit from the information in this episode.

      <title>U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy: Efforts &amp; Challenges in Promoting Public Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/us-surgeon-general-dr-vivek-murthy-efforts-challenges-in-promoting-public-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Vivek Murthy, M.D., the acting U.S. Surgeon General who earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard and his M.D. from Yale School of Medicine. We discuss nutrition, food additives, social media and mental health, public health initiatives to combat the crisis of social isolation, the obesity crisis, addiction and other pressing issues in public health. Dr. Murthy explains the role of the U.S. government in promoting specific public health issues and the steps needed to rebuild public trust in scientific and medical information. We also discuss health care accessibility, insurance barriers and individual versus team-based medical care. We also discuss topics gleaned from listener questions, such as the facts and myths about “Big Pharma” and “Big Food” industries, scientific research and public health policies.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Build and Maintain Healthy Relationships</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-build-and-maintain-healthy-relationships/</link>
      <description>This is episode 3 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist who did his medical training at Stanford School of Medicine and residency at Harvard Medical School. He is the author of the book, “Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic.” Dr. Conti explains how to find, develop and strengthen healthy relationships — including romantic relationships, work and colleague relationships, and friendships. He explains a roadmap of the conscious and unconscious mind that can allow anyone to navigate conflicts better and set healthy boundaries in relationships. We also discuss common features of unhealthy relationships and clinically supported tools for dealing with relationship insecurity, excessive anxiety, past traumas, manipulation and abuse. Dr. Conti explains how, in healthy relationships, there emerges a dynamic of the mutually generative “us” and how to continually improve that dynamic. The next episode in this special series explores true self-care, which can be cultivated through a process of building self-awareness along with other important practices.

      <title>How to Use Music to Boost Motivation, Mood &amp; Improve Learning</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-use-music-to-boost-motivation-mood-and-improve-learning</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe how your brain and body are fundamentally wired to perceive and respond to music and how those responses can be leveraged to improve your mood, allow for processing sad emotions and enhance learning and performance. I explain the data showing how music can increase motivation for cognitive or physical work, what specific music has been shown to enhance cognitive performance, and whether silence or music is more effective in enhancing focus while studying. I also discuss how specific musical pieces can rapidly reduce anxiety, as well as certain prescription medications. I explain how listening to certain types of music can improve various health metrics (e.g., heart rate). Finally, I discuss how music helps to enhance neuroplasticity (rewiring of brain connections), thereby improving learning and memory. Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.

Whether you sing, play an instrument or enjoy listening to music, this episode provides numerous science-informed tools for using music to enhance productivity, mood, emotional states, and overall enjoyment of life.</p><p>For show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-use-music-to-boost-motivation-mood-and-improve-learning">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><p>Use <a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/TRXvr4o5">Ask Huberman Lab</a>, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.</p><h2><strong>Thank you to our sponsors</strong></h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://drinkag1.com/huberman">https://drinkag1.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Music &amp; Your Brain</p><p>(00:03:32) The Brain Body Contract</p><p>(00:03:49) Sponsors: LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>(00:07:09) Music &amp; Emotions; Brain &amp; Body Interpretation</p><p>(00:13:03) Music &amp; Intent; Babies, Music &amp; Movement</p><p>(00:19:19) Tool: Health Metrics &amp; Music, Breathing &amp; Heart Rate</p><p>(00:29:16) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:30:50) Music, Brain &amp; Predictions</p><p>(00:38:07) Music &amp; Brain: Novelty, Arousal, Memories</p><p>(00:44:22) Tool: Movement; Motivation &amp; Faster Music</p><p>(00:50:49) Tool: Cognitive Work &amp; Binaural Beats</p><p>(00:54:11) Silence or Music for Studying?, White Noise, Binaural Beats</p><p>(00:58:47) Tool: Retain Information &amp; Internal Dialogue</p><p>(01:00:53) Tool: Focus, Work Breaks &amp; Music</p><p>(01:04:11) Physical Exercise, Performance &amp; Music</p><p>(01:08:43) Music &amp; Shifting Mood</p><p>(01:14:41) “Happy” vs. “Sad” Music, “One-Hit Wonders” &amp; Artificial Intelligence</p><p>(01:19:30) “Bass Face”; Music, Movement &amp; Facial Expressions</p><p>(01:22:46) Tools: Shift to Happy Mood with Music; Sad Mood Catharsis</p><p>(01:27:30) Tool: Music &amp; Reducing Anxiety, “Weightless”</p><p>(01:31:16) Playing Instruments, Singing &amp; Brain Connectivity</p><p>(01:39:58) Music &amp; the Brain</p><p>(01:42:14) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, YouTube Feedback, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Improve Your Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-improve-your-mental-health</link>
      <description>This is episode 2 of a 4-part special series on mental health with Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a Stanford and Harvard-trained psychiatrist currently running a clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group. Dr. Conti explains specific tools for how to overcome life’s challenges using a framework of self-inquiry that explores all the key elements of self, including defense mechanisms, behaviors, self-awareness and attention. We also discuss our internal driving forces, how to align them and ultimately, how to cultivate a powerful “generative drive” of positive, aspirational pursuits. Dr. Conti also explains how to adjust your internal narratives, reduce self-limiting concepts, overcome intrusive thoughts, and how certain defense mechanisms, such as “acting out” or narcissism, show up in ourselves and others. The next episode in this special series explores how to build healthy relationships with others.

      <title>Journal Club With Dr. Peter Attia | Metformin for Longevity &amp; the Power of Belief Effects</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/journal-club-with-dr-peter-attia-metformin-for-longevity-and-the-power-of-belief-effects</link>
      <description>In this journal club episode, my guest is Stanford and Johns Hopkins-trained physician, Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who is also the host of The Drive podcast and the author of the bestselling book "Outlive: The Science &amp; Art of Longevity."
We each present a scientific paper and discuss the findings' strengths, weaknesses and actionable takeaways.
First, we discuss an article that addresses whether taking the drug metformin can enhance longevity. Then, we discuss an article on belief effects (similar to placebo effects), showing how the effects of a drug on the brain and cognition depend on one's belief about the dose of the drug taken, not the actual dose.
Our conversation also highlights how to read, interpret and critique scientific studies. This episode ought to be of interest to those curious about health and longevity, medicine and psychology and for anyone seeking to better understand how to read and digest scientific findings.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Paul Conti: How to Understand &amp; Assess Your Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-paul-conti-how-to-understand-and-assess-your-mental-health/</link>
      <description>This is episode 1 of a 4-part special series on mental health with psychiatrist Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., who trained at Stanford School of Medicine and completed his residency at Harvard Medical School before founding his clinical practice, the Pacific Premiere Group. Dr. Conti defines mental health in actionable terms and describes the foundational elements of the self, including the structure and function of the unconscious and conscious mind, which give rise to all our thoughts, behaviors and emotions. He also explains how to explore and address the root causes of anxiety, low confidence, negative internal narratives, over-thinking and how our unconscious defense mechanisms operate. This episode provides a foundational roadmap to assess your sense of self and mental health. It offers tools to reshape negative emotions, thought patterns and behaviors — either through self-exploration or with a licensed professional. The subsequent three episodes in this special series explore additional tools to further understand and improve your mental health.

      <title>Marc Andreessen: How Risk Taking, Innovation &amp; Artificial Intelligence Transform Human Experience</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/marc-andreessen-how-risk-taking-innovation-and-artificial-intelligence-transform-human-experience</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Marc Andreessen, the legendary software innovator who co-created the internet browser Mosaic, co-founded Netscape, and is now at Andreessen Horowitz — a venture capital firm that finds and brings to life technologies that transform humanity. We discuss what it takes to be a true innovator, including the personality traits required, the role of environment and the support systems needed to bring revolutionary ideas to fruition. We discuss risk-taking as a necessary but potentially hazardous trait, as well as the role of intrinsic motivation and one’s ability to navigate uncertainty. We also discuss artificial intelligence (AI) and Marc’s stance that soon everyone will use AI as their personalized coach and guide for making decisions about their health, relationships, finances and more — all of which he believes will greatly enhance our quality of life. We also delve into nuclear power, gene editing, public trust, universities, politics, and AI regulation. This episode is for those interested in the innovative mind, psychology, human behavior, technology, culture and politics.

      <title>AMA #10: Benefits of Nature &amp; “Grounding," Hearing Loss Research &amp; Avoiding Altitude Sickness</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the 10th Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>Goals Toolkit: How to Set &amp; Achieve Your Goals</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/goals-toolkit-how-to-set-achieve-your-goals</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe science-based protocols to set and achieve your goals in a way that maximizes the likelihood of reaching them. I explain how to define a priority and reach a specific goal by systematically assessing the challenge level, measurability, milestones, and action states needed to make progress from start to finish. I also explain research-supported tools to improve your performance during cognitive or physical goal work — including directed visualization, variable reward timing, and optimizing your physical environment. I also dispel common myths about goal setting and achievement. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit of zero-cost strategies for goal-setting, goal-pursuit, and goal-completion that can be applied to any physical or cognitive endeavor.

      <title>Dr. David Linden: Life, Death &amp; the Neuroscience of Your Unique Experience</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-david-linden-life-death-and-the-neuroscience-of-your-unique-experience</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Linden, Ph.D., professor of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the author of many popular books about the brain. We discuss individual differences between people — focusing on differences in how people sense the world around them and the roles that chance, heredity, and life experiences (even in utero) play in determining our physical and cognitive traits. We discuss the bidirectional connection between the mind and body and how our thoughts and mental practices (e.g., meditation and breathwork) impact our health. We also discuss the link between inflammation and depression. We also discuss Dr. Linden’s terminal illness diagnosis, his mindset during chemotherapy and what his diagnosis has taught him about the mind, gratitude, time perception and life. This episode also covers sensual touch, cerebellar function, and epigenetic inheritance and ought to be of interest to all interested in neuroscience, genetics, psychology and human development.

      <title>Ketamine: Benefits and Risks for Depression, PTSD &amp; Neuroplasticity</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/ketamine-benefits-and-risks-for-depression-ptsd-and-neuroplasticity</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how ketamine causes rewiring of brain circuits and dissociative states to relieve symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I explain how ketamine impacts both the brain’s glutamate and its endogenous opioid pathways, which together regulate mood and well-being. I discuss how ketamine therapy is used clinically to treat major depression, bipolar depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), suicidality and other psychiatric challenges. I also describe how ketamine causes the subjective effects of dissociation and euphoria and, at higher doses, is an anesthetic. I compare the different routes of ketamine administration, dosages and forms of ketamine, and if micro-dosing ketamine is effective. I also highlight the potential risks of recreational ketamine use (and the colloquial term ‘K-holes’). This episode should interest anyone interested in ketamine, treatments for depression, neuroplasticity mechanisms, psychiatry and mental health.

      <title>AMA #9: Kratom Risks, Does Infrared Sauna Work &amp; Journaling Benefits</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the ninth Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>Dr. Maya Shankar: How to Shape Your Identity &amp; Goals</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-maya-shankar-how-to-shape-your-identity-and-goals</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Maya Shankar, Ph.D., a cognitive scientist, former senior advisor to the White House and Chair of the White House Social and Behavioral Sciences Team. She is the creator and host of the podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity. Dr. Shankar shares her experience of redefining her identity after an early career-ending setback. She also explains numerous science-based strategies to effectively define goals, structure our goal pursuits and maintain consistent motivation. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit and roadmap to assess your identity and goals and positively transform in the face of change.

      <title>How to Enhance Performance &amp; Learning by Applying a Growth Mindset</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-enhance-performance-and-learning-by-applying-a-growth-mindset</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset — the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort — to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating “verbs” (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the “stress-is-enhancing mindset,” and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I discuss how to build and apply a growth mindset — the practice of self-rewarding and focusing on learning and skill development through effort — to improve learning and performance. I also discuss how our internal narratives drive our ability to make progress. I contrast the growth mindset vs. the fixed mindset and describe how the type of feedback or praise we receive shapes our mindsets, and the huge advantage of rewarding and celebrating “verbs” (actions) rather than adjectives (performance labels). I also discuss data showing how stress can enhance performance and explain why the growth mindset works synergistically with the “stress-is-enhancing mindset,” and how to combine them. Whether you are a student, coach, therapist, parent, teacher or simply someone seeking to improve at something, this episode provides numerous science-supported tools for how to adopt a performance enhancing mindset.

      <title>Dr. Robert Malenka: How Your Brain’s Reward Circuits Drive Your Choices</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-malenka-how-your-brains-reward-circuits-drive-your-choices</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Robert Malenka, MD, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine who has made numerous seminal discoveries of how the brain changes (neuroplasticity) in response to learning and in response to rewarding and reinforcing experiences. We discuss the brain’s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders. This episode should be of interest to those interested in neuroplasticity, social bonding, addiction, autism, learning and motivation.

      <title>Science-Supported Tools to Accelerate Your Fitness Goals</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/science-supported-tools-to-accelerate-your-fitness-goals</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain a set of fitness tools gleaned from the 6-part guest series on fitness, exercise and performance with Dr. Andy Galpin. First, I explain the essential components of a well-rounded fitness program for lifelong health and performance including the minimum requirements for progressive resistance and cardiovascular training. Then, I discuss 12 valuable science-supported fitness tools that take a small amount of time to implement, yet all of which can greatly enhance your level of fitness. These include short endurance-enhancing and strength and hypertrophy-enhancing tools, as well as psychological, respiration (breathing), nutrition and supplementation-based tools — all of which will improve your fitness in meaningful ways and can be easily layered into existing exercise programs to improve your fitness and performance outcomes.

These include short endurance-enhancing and strength and hypertrophy-enhancing tools, as well as psychological, respiration (breathing), nutrition and supplementation-based tools — all of which will improve your fitness in meaningful ways and can be easily layered into existing exercise programs to improve your fitness and performance outcomes.</p><p>For show notes, including referenced articles and additional resources, please visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/science-supported-tools-to-accelerate-your-fitness-goals">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><p>Use <a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/1qtATqbE">Ask Huberman Lab</a>, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Tools to Improve Fitness</p><p>(00:02:52) Sponsors: LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>(00:05:13) Foundational Fitness Program</p><p>(00:13:33) Tool 1: Zone 2 Cardio &amp; Daily Activities</p><p>(00:20:33) Tool 2: Low Repetition Strength Training, 3 x 5 Protocol, Warm-Up Sets</p><p>(00:33:11) Age-Related Strength Decline</p><p>(00:34:31) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)</p><p>(00:38:08) Tool 3: “Sugarcane” Endurance Protocol</p><p>(00:43:29) Tool 4: Exercise “Snacks”; Cardiovascular &amp; Muscular Endurance</p><p>(00:55:31) Tool 5: Rest Period &amp; Physiological Sighs</p><p>(01:00:20) Tool 6: Down-Regulation Breathing &amp; Recovery</p><p>(01:05:38) Tool 7: “The Line”</p><p>(01:09:55) Tool 8: Smartphone Use &amp; Training</p><p>(01:13:44) Tool 9: Omega-3 Fatty Acids</p><p>(01:15:37) Tool 10: Creatine</p><p>(01:20:08) Tool 11: Rhodiola Rosea</p><p>(01:25:13) Tool 12: Training Fasted or Fed, Caffeine</p><p>(01:31:09) Training Session Flexibility</p><p>(01:33:37) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg: How to Improve Your Eye Health &amp; Offset Vision Loss</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-jeffrey-goldberg-how-to-improve-your-eye-health-and-offset-vision-loss</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Jeffrey Goldberg, MD, PhD, professor and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the Byers Eye Institute at Stanford University. His clinical and research efforts focus on retinal and optic nerve diseases such as glaucoma and discovering stem cell and nanotechnology treatments to cure blindness. We discuss how to maintain and improve eye health throughout life, the advantages and disadvantages of corrective lenses, including if you should wear “readers,” the use and risks of contact lenses, considerations for LASIK eye surgery, floaters, dry eye, the importance of sunlight and UV protection and specific exercises to improve eye and vision health. Dr. Goldberg also explains age-related conditions: cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy; and the behavioral and supplementation-based, prescription and surgical tools used to promote eye health. This episode provides essential tools for listeners of any age and background to maintain eye health and offset vision loss.

      <title>AMA #8: Balancing Caffeine, Decision Fatigue &amp; Social Isolation</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the eighth Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>Tim Ferriss: How to Learn Better &amp; Create Your Best Future</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/tim-ferriss-how-to-learn-better-and-create-your-best-future</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Tim Ferriss — a five-time #1 New York Times bestselling author, technology investor and host of the iconic podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show. We discuss Tim’s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery — themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim’s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners, as Tim’s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts. What distinguishes Tim is his ability to thoughtfully deconstruct these processes in order to teach others how to do the same.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, my guest is <a href="https://tim.blog/">Tim Ferriss</a> — a five-time #1 New York Times bestselling author, technology investor and host of the iconic podcast, <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">The Tim Ferriss Show</a>. We discuss Tim’s process of exploration, experimentation and mastery — themes that have spanned his career that have placed him on the cutting-edge of many important fields. Tim explains what questions to ask when approaching any new endeavor in order to maximize success. He also explains how to incorporate structure and playfulness into skill and knowledge mastery, how to find and work with mentors, the key importance of location and networks in creating truly impactful things. We also discuss Tim’s philanthropic efforts to support research on psychedelics for the treatment of mental health challenges and we discuss his latest creative endeavors. This episode should be of interest to a wide range of listeners, as Tim’s mastery and wisdom spans athletic and mental pursuits, business, media, technology and the arts. What distinguishes Tim is his ability to thoughtfully deconstruct these processes in order to teach others how to do the same.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/tim-ferriss-how-to-learn-better-and-create-your-best-future">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Tim Ferriss</p><p>(00:04:24) Sponsors: LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>(00:07:43) 4-Hour Body &amp; Development Mindset</p><p>(00:15:22) Origins of Good Ideas</p><p>(00:20:06) Writing &amp; Structured Thinking</p><p>(00:27:58) Writing, Night Owls</p><p>(00:29:50) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:34:21) Investigating Outliers; Social Media &amp; Smartphones</p><p>(00:40:37) Scientific Literacy, Randomized Clinical Trials</p><p>(00:45:09) Supplement &amp; Experiment Fails; Cold Exposure &amp; Hyperthermia</p><p>(00:50:46) Slow Carb Diet &amp; Adherence</p><p>(01:03:35) Morning Protein Intake; Fasting</p><p>(01:09:53) Power of Place; Building Your Network &amp; Volunteering</p><p>(01:21:43) Developing Skills; Examining Motivation &amp; Good Questions; Simplicity</p><p>(01:33:32) Early Psychedelic Exploration, Depression</p><p>(01:45:38) Psychedelic Research &amp; Mental Health Funding</p><p>(01:59:00) Saisei Foundation, Journalism Fellowship, Law &amp; Education</p><p>(02:08:22) Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Psychedelics</p><p>(02:13:28) Meditation, Transcendental Meditation, Nature</p><p>(02:18:50) Extended Nature Retreats &amp; Integration Period; “Generative Drive”</p><p>(02:28:05) Mentors</p><p>(02:34:53) Mind &amp; Attention Allocation, Social Media, Boredom</p><p>(02:43:08) Cockpunch</p><p>(02:59:18) Suicide &amp; Depression, Sexual Abuse, Vulnerability</p><p>(03:13:18) Making Meaning from Suffering</p><p>(03:18:28) Role Identity, Future</p><p>(03:26:21) Parenthood, Animals &amp; Training</p><p>(03:31:23) Podcasting, Experimentation</p><p>(03:35:47) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>The Science of MDMA &amp; Its Therapeutic Uses: Benefits &amp; Risks</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-mdma-and-its-therapeutic-applications</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss Methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine (MDMA), which is also commonly known as “ecstasy” or “molly,” including how it works in the brain to cause short- and long- term-shifts in emotional processing and its clinical applications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol and other substance-use addictions. I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces “threat detection” and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA “crash,” the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA. This should be of interest to those curious about MDMA, neuropharmacology, the origins of emotional processing in the brain, empathy, PTSD, neuroplasticity, mental health and psychiatry.

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-immordino-yang-how-emotions-and-social-factors-impact-learning/</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Mary Helen Immordino-Yang, EdD, professor of education, psychology and neuroscience at the University of Southern California and director of the Center for Affective Neuroscience, Development, Learning and Education, who has done groundbreaking research on emotions, self-awareness and social interactions and how these impact the way we learn and change across our lifespan. She explains how an understanding of emotions can be leveraged to improve learning in children and in adults, and how the education system should be altered to include new forms of exploration and to facilitate better learning and to include more diverse learning (and teaching) styles. This episode ought to be of interest to anyone interested in how we learn, human development in children and adults, as well as those generally interested in education, psychology or neuroscience.

      <title>AMA #7: Cold Exposure, Maximizing REM Sleep &amp; My Next Scientific Studies</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the seventh Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>Adderall, Stimulants &amp; Modafinil for ADHD: Short- &amp; Long-Term Effects</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/adderall-stimulants-and-modafinil-for-adhd-short-and-long-term-effects</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse and other stimulants work to increase focus and treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I explain the brain circuits involved in focus and the key roles dopamine and norepinephrine play in their regulation. Then I explain how stimulants such as Adderall and Vyvanse can increase focus and reduce hyperactivity in kids or adults with ADHD, and how and why Ritalin and other medications (e.g., Modafinil, Guanfacine) may work better for some. I explain the long-term effects of ADHD medications on height, cardiovascular health, hormones, predisposition to addiction and psychosis, and whether these treatments can be used and then stopped. I also discuss the immense individual variation in dosage sensitivity for these medications and the negative side-effects that occur from recreational use. This episode ought to benefit anyone with ADHD, their parents, those on ADHD medications or anyone curious about how these medications work.

      <title>Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris: The Science of Psychedelics for Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robin-carhart-harris-the-science-of-psychedelics-for-mental-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Robin Carhart-Harris, PhD, distinguished professor of neurology and psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He is one of leading researchers in the study of how psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD and DMT can change the human brain and in doing so, be used to successfully treat various mental health challenges such as major depression, anorexia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and addiction. He explains how psilocybin induces sustained changes in adaptive brain wiring and cognition. We discuss the key components of safe and effective psychedelic journeys, the role of hallucinations, the use of eye-masks to encourage people to “go internal,” and music, as well as what effective therapist support consists of before, during and after the session (also known as integration). We discuss micodosing vs. macrodosing and how researchers control for placebo effects in psychedelic research. We also discuss the current legal landscape around psychedelic therapies. Psychedelic therapies are fast emerging as powerful and soon-to-be mainstream treatments for medical health disorders, but they are not without their risks. As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.

As such, this episode ought to be of use to anyone interested in brain plasticity, mental health, psychology or neuroscience.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robin-carhart-harris-the-science-of-psychedelics-for-mental-health">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris</p><p>(00:02:28) Sponsors: LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>(00:05:41) The Brain-Body Contract</p><p>(00:06:31) Origin of the Word: “Psychedelics”; Pharmacology</p><p>(00:12:05) Psychedelics &amp; Revealing the Unconscious Mind, Psychotherapy</p><p>(00:17:32) Microdosing</p><p>(00:26:08) Psilocybin vs. Magic Mushroom Doses</p><p>(00:28:28) “Psychedelic-Therapy”, Music</p><p>(00:31:13) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:36:26) Psychedelic Journey: “Trust, Let Go, Be Open”</p><p>(00:43:01) Negative Emotions, Fear &amp; Psychedelics</p><p>(00:46:21) Global Functional Connectivity, Serotonin 2A Receptor; Subjective Experiences</p><p>(00:52:33) Pharmacology: Therapeutics without Psychedelic Effects; SSRIs</p><p>(00:58:45) Psilocybin &amp; Depression; Long-Term Effects: Connectivity &amp; Neuroplasticity</p><p>(01:10:26) Psilocybin Therapy &amp; Anorexia</p><p>(01:12:56) Integration Phase &amp; Psychedelic-Therapy; Meditation</p><p>(01:19:50) First-Time Psychedelic Use, “Entropic Brain Effect”, Neuroplasticity, Cognition</p><p>(01:30:16) Fibromyalgia &amp; Psychedelic Treatment; MDMA Therapy &amp; “Inner Healer”</p><p>(01:38:55) Placebo Response &amp; Psychedelic Therapy</p><p>(01:41:39) LSD &amp; Psychedelic-Therapy, Micro-Dose</p><p>(01:48:19) Combination Psilocybin-MDMA Therapy</p><p>(01:56:06) DMT “Rocketship” &amp; Serotonin 2A Receptors; Ibogaine</p><p>(02:01:04) “Ego Dissolution”, Cocaine vs. Psychedelics; Relapses</p><p>(02:12:26) Psychedelics &amp; Legal Landscape; Decriminalization</p><p>(02:17:54) MDMA, Trauma &amp; Clinical Trials; Future Regulatory (FDA) Approval?</p><p>(02:23:25) Psilocybin &amp; Current Clinical Trials</p><p>(02:28:41) Mental Health &amp; Psychedelic Treatment, Safeguards, Paradigm Shift</p><p>(02:34:39) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Susanna Søberg: How to Use Cold &amp; Heat Exposure to Improve Your Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-susanna-soberg-how-to-use-cold-and-heat-exposure-to-improve-your-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Susanna Søberg, PhD. She earned her doctoral degree at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, researching the effects of deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure on metabolism and other aspects of human physiology. We discuss how cold or sauna can improve metabolism, cardiovascular and brain health, balance hormones, and decrease inflammation. Dr. Søberg discusses how deliberate cold protocols can improve glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity and trigger release of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine which enhance energy, mood, and focus. We compare cold showers and cold immersion, traditional and infrared saunas, and other variables. This episode provides actionable tools and answers to common questions about the use of deliberate cold and heat to improve health.

      <title>How Psilocybin Can Rewire Our Brain, Its Therapeutic Benefits &amp; Its Risks</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-psilocybin-can-rewire-our-brain-its-therapeutic-benefits-and-its-risks</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss what psilocybin is (chemically) and how it works at the cellular and neural circuit level to trigger neuroplasticity, which is our brain’s ability to rewire itself in ways that lead to long-lasting shifts in our emotional, cognitive and behavioral patterns and abilities. I discuss the emerging clinical trial evidence for the use of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, addictions and other psychiatric challenges. I explain the typical duration and phases of a psilocybin journey, the different categories of dosages often used and I explain the importance of set, setting and support when using psychedelics. I explain which groups of people place themselves at great risk by taking psilocybin as well as groups that could benefit, and I highlight the rapidly changing legal and medical landscape around psilocybin. This episode is a thorough exploration of psilocybin from the scientific and clinical literature perspective and ought to be of interest to anyone curious about psilocybin, mental health, neuroplasticity and/or psychedelics more generally.

      <title>Dr. Noam Sobel: How Smells Influence Our Hormones, Health &amp; Behavior</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-noam-sobel-how-smells-influence-our-hormones-health-and-behavior</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Noam Sobel, PhD, professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the Weizmann Institute of Science. Dr. Sobel explains his lab’s research on the biological mechanisms of smell (“olfaction”) and how sensing odorants and chemicals in our environment impacts human behavior, cognition, social connections, and hormones. He explains how smell is a crucial component of “social sensing” and how we use olfaction when meeting new people to determine things about their physiology and psychology, and he explains how this impacts friendships and romantic partners. He explains how smell influences emotions, hormone levels, memories and the relationship between breathing and autonomic homeostasis. He describes how smell-based screening tests can aid disease diagnosis and explains his lab’s work on digitization of smell — which may soon allow online communication to include “sending of odors” via the internet. Dr. Sobel’s work illustrates how sensitive human olfaction is and how it drives much of our biology and behavior.

      <title>AMA #6: Eye Health, Why We Yawn &amp; Increasing Motivation</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the sixth Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>Science-Based Mental Training &amp; Visualization for Improved Learning</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/science-based-mental-training-and-visualization-for-improved-learning</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explore the science of mental visualization and its application for learning motor and cognitive skills. I discuss neuroplasticity-based skill development and the roles of focus, sleep, movement restriction, and agitation. I then present five key principles of mental visualization to enhance learning speed, accuracy, and consistency. I also provide examples of specific protocols, including repetitions, rest periods, and session frequency, and how to adapt these methods for injuries or breaks from traditional training. Throughout, I reference the scientific studies supporting these concepts. This episode should allow anyone to learn or teach more effectively through the use of mental visualization and training.

      <title>Dr. Matthew MacDougall: Neuralink &amp; Technologies to Enhance Human Brains</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-matthew-macdougall-neuralink-and-technologies-to-enhance-human-brains</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Matthew MacDougall, MD, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink’s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, Huntington’s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink’s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink’s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, my guest is Matthew MacDougall, MD, the head neurosurgeon at Neuralink. Dr. MacDougall trained at the University of California, San Diego and Stanford University School of Medicine and is a world expert in brain stimulation, repair and augmentation. He explains Neuralink’s mission and projects to develop and use neural implant technologies and robotics to 1) restore normal movement to paralyzed patients and those with neurodegeneration-based movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson’s, Huntington’s Disease) and to repair malfunctions of deep brain circuitry (e.g., those involved in addiction). He also discusses Neuralink’s efforts to create novel brain-machine interfaces (BMI) that enhance human learning, cognition and communication as a means to accelerate human progress. Dr. MacDougall also explains other uses of bio-integrated machines in daily life; for instance, he implanted himself with a radio chip into his hand that allows him to open specific doors, collect and store data and communicate with machines and other objects in unique ways. Listeners will learn about brain health and function through the lens of neurosurgery, neurotechnology, clinical medicine and Neuralink’s bold and unique mission. Anyone interested in how the brain works and can be made to work better ought to derive value from this discussion.

      <title>The Science of Healthy Hair, Hair Loss and How to Regrow Hair</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-healthy-hair-hair-loss-and-how-to-regrow-hair</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biology of hair, hair growth, why hair growth slows and what causes hair to stop growing and/or “fall out.” I discuss the essential role of hair stem cells and other supporting biological factors for healthy hair growth. Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair “dead” (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress. This episode explains the mechanisms underlying hair regrowth tools and the science behind them so that you can evaluate potential treatments and associated side-effect profiles and select the best one(s) for you.

      <title>Dr. Elissa Epel: Control Stress for Healthy Eating, Metabolism &amp; Aging</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-elissa-epel-control-stress-for-healthy-eating-metabolism-and-aging</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Elissa Epel, Ph.D., professor and vice chair of the department of psychiatry at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and the author of a new book entitled "The Stress Prescription." We discuss her work showing how stress impacts mood, eating behavior, mental health, physical health, and aging. She explains stress intervention tools using “top-down” techniques (e.g., radical acceptance, mindfulness, reframing), body-based methods (e.g., breathwork) including the Wim Hof Method, exercise, meditation, body scans, and environmental shifts proven to help people cease unhealthy rumination patterns. We discuss how stress can positively impact psychology and sense of purpose, how stress affects cellular aging, how our narratives of stressful events impact our mood and biology, and how to effectively reframe stress. She explains science-based techniques to break stress-induced cycles of craving and overeating and thereby improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic health. Dr. Epel provides a wide range of tools shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving various aspects of our health.

Dr. Epel provides a wide range of tools shown to be effective in reducing stress and improving various aspects of our health.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-elissa-epel-control-stress-for-healthy-eating-metabolism-and-aging">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Elissa Epel</p><p>(00:02:33) Sponsors: LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>(00:06:18) Stress; Effects on Body &amp; Mind</p><p>(00:12:50) Tools: Overthinking &amp; Stress</p><p>(00:15:37) Acute, Moderate &amp; Chronic Stress, Breathing</p><p>(00:21:23) Stress Benefits, Aging &amp; Cognition; Stress Challenge Response</p><p>(00:27:23) Sponsor: AG1 (Athletic Greens)</p><p>(00:32:19) Tool: Shifting Stress to Challenge Response, “Stress Shields”</p><p>(00:37:400 Stress, Overeating, Craving &amp; Opioid System</p><p>(00:48:55) Tools: Breaking Overeating Cycles, Mindfulness</p><p>(00:54:44) Soda &amp; Sugary Drinks</p><p>(01:00:51) Smoking, Processed Food &amp; Rebellion</p><p>(01:06:47) Tools: Mindfulness, Pregnancy &amp; Metabolic Health</p><p>(01:14:11) Body Scan &amp; Cravings</p><p>(01:17:28) Tool: Meditation &amp; Aging; Meditation Retreats</p><p>(01:23:35) Meditation, Psychedelics &amp; Neuroplasticity</p><p>(01:26:02) Mitochondrial Health, Stress &amp; Mood</p><p>(01:29:49) Chronic Stress &amp; Radical Acceptance, “Brick Wall”</p><p>(01:37:57) Tool: Control, Uncertainty</p><p>(01:45:25) Stress Management, “Skillful Surfing”</p><p>(01:50:25) Narrative, Purpose &amp; Stress</p><p>(01:52:49) Breathwork, Wim Hof Method, Positivity &amp; Cellular Aging</p><p>(02:03:11) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Leverage Dopamine to Overcome Procrastination &amp; Optimize Effort</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/leverage-dopamine-to-overcome-procrastination-and-optimize-effort</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how dopamine dynamics — meaning changes and interactions between our baseline and peak levels of dopamine drive our cravings and sense of motivation. I also explain how to leverage dopamine dynamics to overcome procrastination. I cover behavioral, cognitive, nutrition-based and supplementation-based tools to optimize baseline and peak dopamine levels to ensure a persistently motivated state. I also discuss how to boost motivation when you are in a rut, why you might not want to stack behaviors/substances that spike dopamine and how to build and maintain a “growth mindset” for pursuing goals of any kind. Dopamine is an incredibly powerful neuromodulator involved in basic functions (e.g., hunger, romantic attraction, etc.) and feats of cognitive and physical performance; by understanding the dynamics of dopamine, listeners ought to be better positioned to overcome procrastination, maintain motivation, and improve confidence.

      <title>AMA #5: Intrusive Thoughts, CGMs, Behavioral Change, Naps &amp; NSDR</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the fifth Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>Dr. Peter Attia: Improve Vitality, Emotional &amp; Physical Health &amp; Lifespan</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-peter-attia-improve-vitality-emotional-and-physical-health-and-lifespan</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Peter Attia, M.D. He completed his medical and advanced training at Stanford University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Dr. Attia is host of the health and medicine podcast, The Drive, and the author of a new book, “Outlive: The Science &amp; Art of Longevity,” which examines disease prevention and healthy aging, including emotional health. He explains the leading causes of death worldwide and how to measure one’s risk of death and mitigate each risk factor. Dr. Attia shares how, in addition to blood-based markers of lipids and hormones, there are behavioral measures and interventions, and key aspects of emotional health (i.e., relationships, emotional stability, purpose, etc.) that fundamentally impact our physical health and longevity, and how to assess and adjust our emotional health. This episode is rich with actionable information related to disease screening and biomarker testing, nutritional, exercise, behavior and prescription-based tools that area useful to all people regardless of age, male or female, and that can significantly improve vitality, health and lifespan.

This episode is rich with actionable information related to disease screening and biomarker testing, nutritional, exercise, behavior and prescription-based tools that area useful to all people regardless of age, male or female, and that can significantly improve vitality, health and lifespan.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-peter-attia-improve-vitality-emotional-and-physical-health-and-lifespan">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Peter Attia</p><p>(00:03:39) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:07:34) Lifespan vs. Healthspan</p><p>(00:10:54) “4 Horseman of Death”, Diseases of Atherosclerosis</p><p>(00:14:44) Tool: Hypertension &amp; Stroke, Blood Pressure Testing </p><p>(00:23:14) Preventing Atherosclerosis, Smoking &amp; Vaping, Pollution</p><p>(00:28:33) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:33:29) Cholesterol, ApoB</p><p>(00:42:21) Cholesterol Levels, LDL &amp; ApoB Testing</p><p>(00:49:29) ApoB Levels &amp; Atherosclerosis, Causality</p><p>(01:01:06) ApoB Reduction, Insulin Resistance, Statins, Ezetimibe, PCSK9 Inhibitors</p><p>(01:12:30) Monitoring ApoB</p><p>(01:18:30) Reducing Blood Pressure, Exercise &amp; Sleep</p><p>(01:20:50) High Blood Pressure &amp; Kidneys</p><p>(01:23:11) Alcohol, Sleep &amp; Disease Risk</p><p>(01:31:21) Cancer &amp; Cancer Risks: Genetics, Smoking &amp; Obesity</p><p>(01:39:47) Cancer Screening &amp; Survival</p><p>(01:44:17) Radiation Risks, CT &amp; PET Scans</p><p>(01:48:48) Environmental Carcinogens</p><p>(01:52:11) Genetic &amp; Whole-Body MRI Screening, Colonoscopy</p><p>(01:58:47) Neurodegenerative Diseases, Alzheimer’s Disease, ApoE</p><p>(02:08:08) Alzheimer’s Disease &amp; Amyloid</p><p>(02:13:58) Interventions for Brain Health, Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</p><p>(02:21:26) Accidental Death, “Deaths of Despair”, Fentanyl Crisis</p><p>(02:31:20) Fall Risk &amp; Stability, 4 Pillars of Strength Training</p><p>(02:41:05) Emotional Health</p><p>(02:53:45) Mortality &amp; Preserving Relationship Quality</p><p>(03:02:20) Relationships vs. Outcomes, Deconstructing Emotions</p><p>(03:09:34) Treatment Centers, Emotional Processing &amp; Recovery</p><p>(03:16:34) Tool: Inner Monologue &amp; Anger, Redirecting Self-Talk</p><p>(03:27:37) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Satchin Panda: Intermittent Fasting to Improve Health, Cognition &amp; Longevity</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-satchin-panda-intermittent-fasting-to-improve-health-cognition-and-longevity/</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Satchin Panda, PhD, professor and the director of the Regulatory Biology Laboratories at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. We discuss his lab’s discovery that “time-restricted eating” (TRE) aka intermittent fasting, is beneficial effects for metabolic health and longevity. Dr. Panda explains how TRE, and also longer fasts, can positively impact obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular health, age-related chronic diseases, and improve mood and cognitive performance. He also describes how the timing of eating, light exposure and exercise that ~50% of all people engage in, negatively impacts their health and explains how specific simple adjustments to these can positively shift their subjective feelings of health and biomarkers of cardiovascular function, glucose regulation and metabolism. We discuss how our circadian behaviors, which include our patterns of eating, sleeping and socializing, have an enormous impact on our biology, mood and health and how by simply confining our calorie consumption to a semi-regular daily window, can positively impact our physical health, mental health and longevity.

      <title>How to Optimize Your Water Quality &amp; Intake for Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-optimize-your-water-quality-and-intake-for-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss our body’s most vital and essential nutrient—water. I explain the structure of water and how it is used by the cells and tissues of our body, how much water we each need to drink and when in order to optimize our mental focus and physical performance; and I include how exercise, humidity, heat, and caffeine affect our hydration needs. I explain how temperature and pH influence water’s physical properties and if there is any scientific basis for drinking so-called “pH water” or “alkalized water” to improve health. I explain how to test your tap water for contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors) and the documented problems with fluoride in drinking water. I provide options for filtering drinking water and describe different water types (e.g., reverse osmosis, hydrogen-enriched, electrolyzed reduced, deuterium depleted, etc.). Since the human body is mostly water (55-80% depending on one’s age) and water has essential roles in health, disease and cellular function, everyone ought to benefit from understanding how best to clean our tap water, hydrate effectively and in some cases, adjust the type of water we drink to allow our brain and body to function optimally in regard to health and performance.

      <title>Dr. Oded Rechavi: Genes &amp; the Inheritance of Memories Across Generations</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-oded-rechavi-genes-and-the-inheritance-of-memories-across-generations</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Oded Rechavi, Ph.D., professor of neurobiology at Tel Aviv University and expert in how genes are inherited, how experiences shape genes and remarkably, how some memories of experiences can be passed via genes to offspring. We discuss his research challenging long-held tenets of genetic inheritance and the relevance of those findings to understanding key biological and psychological processes including metabolism, stress and trauma. He describes the history of the scientific exploration of the “heritability of acquired traits” and how epigenetics and RNA biology can account for some of the passage of certain experience-based memories. He discusses the importance of model organisms in scientific research and describes his work on how stressors and memories can be passed through small RNA molecules to multiple generations of offspring in ways that meaningfully affect their behavior. Nature vs. nurture is a commonly debated theme; Dr. Rechavi’s work represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of that debate, as well as genetic inheritance, brain function and evolution.

      <title>AMA #4: Maintain Motivation, Improve REM Sleep, Set Goals, Manage Anxiety &amp; More</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the fourth Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

(00:01:27) How to achieve consistent state of motivation? [Martin Zokov]
In the full AMA episode, we discuss:

Are there neurological benefits from different types of body work?

Are goals necessary for the growth mindset and how to set the best short and long-term goals for creativity?

Is anxiety useful? Can it be controlled?

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Andy Galpin: Optimal Nutrition &amp; Supplementation for Fitness</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-optimal-nutrition-and-supplementation-for-fitness</link>
      <description>In this episode 6 of a 6-part series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, he explains optimal nutrition, hydration and supplementation to achieve your fitness goals. We cover macronutrient guidelines, when to eat relative to training and training fasted versus fed. Dr. Galpin describes proper hydration for before and during exercise, how dehydration and/or low electrolyte concentrations impede physical and mental performance. He discusses what supplements work best for fitness and performance, how to decide which to take, if any, and when to take them. He also shares high-impact, lower-cost supplements and nutrition recommendations to benefit performance, recovery, and sleep. This episode also includes an audience Q&amp;A. Overall, it is an in-depth but clear discussion of nutrition strategies and supplements that can help anyone improve their level of fitness physical and mental performance.

      <title>How to Breathe Correctly for Optimal Health, Mood, Learning &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-breathe-correctly-for-optimal-health-mood-learning-and-performance/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biology of breathing (respiration), how it delivers oxygen and carbon dioxide to the cells and tissues of the body and how is best to breathe—nose versus mouth, fast versus slow, deliberately versus reflexively, etc., depending on your health and performance needs. I discuss the positive benefits of breathing properly for mood, to reduce psychological and physiological stress, to halt sleep apnea, and improve facial aesthetics and immune system function. I also compare what is known about the effects and effectiveness of different breathing techniques, including physiological sighs, box breathing and cyclic hyperventilation, “Wim Hof Method,” Prānāyāma yogic breathing and more. I also describe how to breath to optimize learning, memory and reaction time and I explain breathing at high altitudes, why “overbreathing” is bad, and how to breathe specifically to relieve cramps and hiccups. Breathwork practices are zero-cost and require minimal time yet provide a unique and powerful avenue to improve overall quality of life that is grounded in clear physiology. Anyone interesting in improving their mental and physical health or performance in any endeavor ought to benefit from the information and tools in this episode.

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Andy Galpin: Maximize Recovery to Achieve Fitness &amp; Performance Goals</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-maximize-recovery-to-achieve-fitness-and-performance-goals</link>
      <description>In this episode 5 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, he explains how to optimize post-training recovery and how to avoid overtraining in order to better achieve your fitness and exercise goals. He explains the cellular mechanisms of muscle soreness and pain, why adequate recovery is essential for all physical adaptations, and how to enhance recovery using breathwork, thermal, movement, and pressure-based techniques. He describes how overtraining impedes exercise progress and how to assess if you are overreaching or overtraining, by using specific biomarkers and indicators. Like other performance metrics, recovery is a skill that can and should be trained, and that can be learned. This episode provides an actionable toolkit for how to monitor and improve your exercise recovery abilities, which will improve your overall mental and physical health.

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-gina-poe-use-sleep-to-enhance-learning-memory-and-emotional-state</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Gina Poe, PhD, a professor in the department of integrative biology &amp; physiology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). We discuss her research exploring how sleep impacts learning, memory, hormones and emotions. She discusses tools to enhance your quality of sleep, increase deep sleep, rapid eye movement sleep and growth hormone release-- a key hormone for health, immune function and vitality. Dr. Poe explains how a specific brain area, the locus coeruleus, facilitates the processing of emotions, helps relieve traumas and how to maximize locus coeruleus function. She also explains sleep’s vital role in opiate addiction recovery and how anyone can determine their optimal sleep timing and duration. This episode is rich with basic science information and zero-cost tools to enhance quality and effectiveness of sleep for sake of mental health, physical health and performance.

      <title>How to Stop Headaches Using Science-Based Approaches</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-stop-headaches-using-science-based-approaches</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the causes and treatments of different types of headaches, including tension headaches, migraines, sinus and cluster headaches, as well as menstrual and other hormone-based headaches. I describe how to distinguish between the different headache types and how to select the right treatment, including prescription-based and non-prescription-based treatments, behavioral and nutrition-based approaches. I also explain the evidence and mechanisms supporting the use of omega-3 fatty acids, high dose creatine, peppermint oil, turmeric, acupuncture and more. Additionally, I touch on traumatic brain injury, the causes of photophobia, aura, and the link between spicy foods and thunderclap headaches. By the end of this episode, listeners and viewers will have a comprehensive understanding of headaches, their types and the best way to prevent and stop them.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I discuss the causes and treatments of different types of headaches, including tension headaches, migraines, sinus and cluster headaches, as well as menstrual and other hormone-based headaches. I describe how to distinguish between the different headache types and how to select the right treatment, including prescription-based and non-prescription-based treatments, behavioral and nutrition-based approaches. I also explain the evidence and mechanisms supporting the use of omega-3 fatty acids, high dose creatine, peppermint oil, turmeric, acupuncture and more. Additionally, I touch on traumatic brain injury, the causes of photophobia, aura, and the link between spicy foods and thunderclap headaches. By the end of this episode, listeners and viewers will have a comprehensive understanding of headaches, their types and the best way to prevent and stop them.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-stop-headaches-using-science-based-approaches">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Headache</p><p>(00:03:51) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:07:47) Headache Sources: Muscle Tension; Blood Flow &amp; Meninges</p><p>(00:14:06) Headache Sources: Neurons; Inflammation &amp; Sinus Headache </p><p>(00:23:21) 3 Neuron Types, Pain, Tension Headaches</p><p>(00:29:29) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:31:05) Tension Headaches</p><p>(00:34:29) Migraine Headaches, Aura, Photophobia </p><p>(00:43:10) Cluster Headaches</p><p>(00:47:47) Hormone-Based Headaches, Menstrual Cycle &amp; Menopause</p><p>(00:53:38) Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) &amp; Headache, Baseline Health</p><p>(01:02:08) Tool: Headache Treatment, Creatine Monohydrate &amp; TBI</p><p>(01:12:22) InsideTracker</p><p>(01:13:55) Headache Treatment, Omega-3 &amp; Omega-6 Fatty Acids (Linolic Acid)</p><p>(01:22:14) Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-6 Fatty Acids &amp; Inflammation</p><p>(01:28:11) Hormone Headache Treatment &amp; Omega-3s</p><p>(01:31:24) Tool: Aura, Photophobia &amp; Offsetting with Red Light </p><p>(01:44:15) Tool: Tension Headache &amp; Botox Treatment</p><p>(01:49:43) Tool: Alternative Headache Treatments, Peppermint Oil, Menthol</p><p>(02:01:35) Tool: Tension Headaches Treatment &amp; Acupuncture</p><p>(02:05:41) Tool: Migraine &amp; Herbal Treatment, Caffeine Timing</p><p>(02:13:26) Tool: Migraine Treatments &amp; Curcumin (Turmeric)</p><p>(02:18:00) Carolina Reaper Pepper &amp; Thunderclap Headache</p><p>(02:24:21) Zero-Cost Support, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Sponsors, Social Media, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>GUEST SERIES | Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Physical Endurance &amp; Lose Fat </title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-physical-endurance-and-lose-fat</link>
      <description>This is episode 3 of a 6-part special series on fitness, exercise and performance with Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton. He explains protocols to improve the various kinds of physical endurance: muscular endurance, anerobic capacity, maximum aerobic output, and long duration endurance. He also explains how the body uses different energy sources (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) during rest and exercise. He also explains the mechanisms underlying fat loss and how and why exercise accelerates rates of fat loss. We cover the many concepts related to endurance training and fat loss such as metabolic flexibility, breathwork training for exercise performance and recovery, lactate production and regulation, how to improve blood flow to muscles, anaerobic vs. aerobic metabolism, exercise fatigue, low-carbohydrate diets and fat loss, and how to combine different types of workouts to improve overall endurance. This episode in intended for everyone ranging from novice and recreational exercisers to elite endurance athletes. Anyone wishing to improve their physical health and performance stands to benefit from the information.

      <title>Dr. Sara Gottfried: How to Optimize Female Hormone Health for Vitality &amp; Longevity</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-sara-gottfried-how-to-optimize-female-hormone-health-for-vitality-and-longevity</link>
      <description>My guest is Sara Gottfried, M.D., a Harvard-trained, board-certified gynecologist and clinical assistant professor of integrative medicine &amp; nutritional sciences at Thomas Jefferson University. Dr. Gottfried specializes in hormone health, vitality and longevity using precision/personalized approaches. We discuss female hormone health, puberty, perimenopause, and menopause, hormone testing, the microbiome, stress related hormone challenges, their causes, and various treatments. We also discuss fertility, birth control and tools for improving microbiome health, treating PCOS, insulin management, and the best nutrition, supplementation, and exercise programs for women. While the episode focuses mainly on female hormones, males will also  benefit from our discussion because it includes  actionable tools suggested for managing stress, bolstering the gut microbiome, and immunity—all of which stand to improve overall health, vitality and longevity in males and females.

Dr. Gottfried specializes in hormone health, vitality and longevity using precision/personalized approaches. We discuss female hormone health, puberty, perimenopause, and menopause, hormone testing, the microbiome, stress related hormone challenges, their causes, and various treatments. We also discuss fertility, birth control and tools for improving microbiome health, treating PCOS, insulin management, and the best nutrition, supplementation, and exercise programs for women. While the episode focuses mainly on female hormones, males will also  benefit from our discussion because it includes  actionable tools suggested for managing stress, bolstering the gut microbiome, and immunity—all of which stand to improve overall health, vitality and longevity in males and females.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-sara-gottfried-how-to-optimize-female-hormone-health-for-vitality-and-longevity">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Sara Gottfried</p><p>(00:04:07) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:07:50) Women, Family History, Heredity &amp; Environment</p><p>(00:11:00) Puberty, Stress, Menstrual Cycles, Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)</p><p>(00:17:26) Tool: Sex Hormones, Microbiome, Estrobolome &amp; Disease; Biomarker Testing</p><p>(00:25:11) Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome &amp; Disease</p><p>(00:27:33) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:32:22) Microbiome, Prebiotics &amp; Probiotics, Inflammation</p><p>(00:36:08) Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation &amp; Thyroid</p><p>(00:42:25) Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect &amp; Modern Medicine, Stress Factors</p><p>(00:45:13) Constipation, Stress &amp; Trauma, Autonomic Balance</p><p>(00:55:35) Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork &amp; Meditation</p><p>(01:02:58) Systemic &amp; Societal Stress Unique to Females</p><p>(01:09:23) Testing &amp; Future Behavior</p><p>(01:11:55) Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) &amp; Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress </p><p>(01:22:57) PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring and Management; Data Access</p><p>(01:29:48) Behaviors for Vitality; Exercise &amp; Body Phenotype; Cortisol</p><p>(01:36:40) Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine</p><p>(01:42:36) Cortisol, Anxiety &amp; Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience</p><p>(01:48:07) Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators</p><p>(01:54:20) Oral Contraceptives, Benefits &amp; Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone</p><p>(02:06:50) Fertility, Follicular &amp; Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments</p><p>(02:10:29) Menopause &amp; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative</p><p>(02:15:30) Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism &amp; Estrogen</p><p>(02:21:49) Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility </p><p>(02:23:29) Stool Testing</p><p>(02:25:32) Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score &amp; Disease </p><p>(02:31:56) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter, Momentous</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-optimal-protocols-to-build-strength-and-grow-muscles</link>
      <description>In this episode 2 of a 6-part special series, Andy Galpin, PhD, professor of kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton and world expert on exercise science, explains optimal protocols for increasing strength and causing hypertrophy (muscle growth), as well as for increasing speed and power. He explains the training principles and underlying mechanisms for reaching these goals. Our conversation covers a breadth of training topics, including selecting the number of repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods, warm-ups, exercise cadence, breathing, stretching, recovery, training frequency, overcoming plateaus, nutrition, and he gives specific examples of exercises for power, strength, and hypertrophy.

      <title>How to Optimize Fertility in Males &amp; Females</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-optimize-fertility-in-males-and-females</link>
      <description>I discuss the mechanisms by which human eggs and sperm are generated, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, the conception process and overall fertility in males and females. I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover nutritional, behavioral, supplemental, and medicinal approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility—several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity for everyone, regardless of age.

        <![CDATA[<p>I discuss the mechanisms by which human eggs and sperm are generated, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle, the conception process and overall fertility in males and females. I also explain how, regardless of whether you seek to conceive children, optimizing egg and sperm health is directly related to vitality and longevity. I cover nutritional, behavioral, supplemental, and medicinal approaches to optimizing egg and sperm health, the ovulatory/menstrual cycle and fertility. In addition, I explain lifestyle choices that greatly assist or harm fertility—several of which are very surprising. I provide science-based protocols for those trying to conceive children. The tools and principles I discuss can also improve overall vitality and longevity for everyone, regardless of age. </p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Fertility, Vitality &amp; Longevity</p><p>(00:04:24) Sponsors: LMNT</p><p>(00:08:20) Eggs &amp; Sperm, Genes, Fertilization</p><p>(00:18:28) Puberty: Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH), Melatonin &amp; Leptin</p><p>(00:23:38) Onset Trends of Puberty, Odors Effects</p><p>(00:27:44) Female Puberty, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)</p><p>(00:31:46) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:36:34) Ovulatory &amp; Menstrual Cycle</p><p>(00:40:36) Follicular Phase: Egg Maturation &amp; Ovulation, FSH &amp; Estrogen</p><p>(00:51:09) Luteal Phase: Progesterone &amp; Estrogen, Menstruation</p><p>(00:58:14) Ovulation &amp; Libido; Luteal Phase &amp; Malaise; Individual Variability</p><p>(01:04:18) Sex Chromosomes, Sperm</p><p>(01:11:40) Tool: Testicular Temperature &amp; Fertility</p><p>(01:17:22) Sperm Production, Seminal Fluid, Vasectomy</p><p>(01:24:07) Sperm Cells, Mitochondria &amp; Motility, Intercourse Frequency &amp; Fertilization</p><p>(01:28:31) Sperm Production, GnRH, FSH, LH &amp; Testosterone</p><p>(01:36:21) Ejaculate Quality, Sperm Counts, Fertilization, Ectopic Pregnancy</p><p>(01:44:14) Tool: Sexual Intercourse Frequency &amp; Fertilization</p><p>(01:53:24) Tools: Tracking Ovulation, Libido, Lubricants</p><p>(01:56:42) Fecundability: Egg Quality &amp; Woman’s Age, Cumulative Pregnancy Rate</p><p>(02:08:17) Miscarriages, Chromosomal Abnormalities</p><p>(02:11:23) Female Fertility: Age, Follicle Testing &amp; Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Testing</p><p>(02:18:51) Male Fertility: Sperm Analysis, Age</p><p>(02:24:52) Fertility &amp; Hormone Analysis, Age</p><p>(02:29:07) Fertility Effects of Sleep, Cortisol/Stress, Cannabis/Nicotine &amp; Alcohol</p><p>(02:42:40) Fertility, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), Viral Infection &amp; Cystic Fibrosis</p><p>(02:47:42) Tool: Testicular Temperature &amp; Fertility</p><p>(02:51:26) Tool: Phones &amp; Sperm Quality</p><p>(02:58:06) Deliberate Cold Exposure &amp; Fertility, Testicular Temperature, Cortisol/Stress</p><p>(03:05:43) Fertility, Exercise &amp; Mitochondrial Health; Intermittent Fasting</p><p>(03:14:46) Testosterone Replacement Therapy &amp; Sperm Production; Supplements</p><p>(03:20:36) Sex Determination in Offspring, In Vitro Fertilization (IVF), Sperm Fractions</p><p>(03:32:23) Postcoital Female Position &amp; Fertilization, Sperm Quality</p><p>(03:36:57) Cannabis &amp; Sperm Motility, Libido, Pregnancy</p><p>(03:42:33) Acupuncture, Fertility &amp; Pregnancy</p><p>(03:49:25) Fertility Supplements: L-Carnitine &amp; Allicin, Coenzyme Q10</p><p>(03:56:18) Fertility Supplements: Inositol, Omega 3 Fatty Acids</p><p>(04:02:50) Supplements for Hormones: Tongkat Ali, Shilajit, Zinc</p><p>(04:13:02) Fertility &amp; Prescription Medications</p><p>(04:16:44) Human Reproduction &amp; Fertility</p><p>(04:20:12) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Newsletter</p>]]>

      <title>Rick Rubin: How to Access Your Creativity</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/rick-rubin-how-to-access-your-creativity</link>
      <description>My guest is Rick Rubin, one of the most renowned music producers of all time, known for his work with a wide range of artists, including Run DMC, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, JayZ, Adele, Johnny Cash, LL Cool J, Slayer, Neil Young, Ye (formerly Kayne West), Tom Petty, and many more. He is also the author of a new book, "The Creative Act: A Way of Being," which explores the creative process and how to access creativity. We discuss topics such as finding inspiration, the role of feelings as guideposts, learning from observing nature, balancing self-doubt and anxiety, and adopting new perspectives to channel the creative process. Rick also shares his thoughts on using deadlines, eliminating distractions, and how our experiences and emotions influence the creative process. Additionally, we discuss his love for professional wrestling. Our conversation can be applied to any activity or profession to access creativity.

      <title>AMA #3: Adaptogens, Fasting &amp; Fertility, Bluetooth/EMF Risks, Cognitive Load Limits &amp; More</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the third Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>Developing a Rational Approach to Supplementation for Health &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/developing-a-rationale-approach-to-supplementation-for-health-and-performance</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how to design a supplementation protocol to support maximum mental and physical health and performance depending on your specific needs, nutrition, lifestyle and finances. When most people hear about “supplements,” they think they are vitamin supplements, but there are many compounds that are powerful and sold over-the-counter that can enhance our health in performance and that can’t be obtained from foods. First, I discuss “foundational” supplements to support overall health, including water and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes, adaptogens, and prebiotics/probiotics. Then I explain how to use single-ingredient supplements to enhance specific aspects of your physiology, such as aiding sleep, cognitive enhancement, and focus supporting healthy hormone levels (e.g., testosterone, estrogen and growth hormone, thyroid). Finally, I explain when it makes sense to add supplements to your lifestyle and discuss how best to use supplements, including how to determine dosage, sourcing, continuous schedules and cycling, and how to layer different supplements most effectively. This episode will explain how to design the safest, most biologically effective, cost-effective supplementation protocol to meet your particular goals and support your overall health, including vitality and longevity.

      <title>Dr. Sam Harris: Using Meditation to Focus, View Consciousness &amp; Expand Your Mind</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-sam-harris-using-meditation-to-focus-view-consciousness-and-expand-your-mind/</link>
      <description>My guest is Sam Harris, Ph.D. Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of Waking Up and the host of the "Making Sense" podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.

        <![CDATA[<p>My guest is <a href="https://samharris.org/">Sam Harris, Ph.D.</a> Sam earned his bachelor’s degree in philosophy from Stanford University and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in neuroscience from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He is the author of multiple best-selling books and is a world-renowned public-facing intellectual on meditation, consciousness, free will, psychedelics and neuroscience. He is also the creator of <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/huberman">Waking Up</a> and the host of the "<a href="https://www.samharris.org/podcasts">Making Sense</a>" podcast. In this episode, we discuss meditation as a route to understanding “the self” and experiencing consciousness, not just changing one’s conscious state. Sam describes several meditation techniques and their benefits, including how meditation fundamentally changes our worldview and how it can be merged seamlessly into daily life. It can help us overcome universal challenges such as distractibility and persistent, internal dialogue (“chatter”) to allow for deep contentment and pervasive shifts in our awareness, all while acknowledging the more immediate stress-lowering and memory-improving effects of meditation. We also discuss the therapeutic use of psychedelics and the mechanistic similarities between the benefits of a psychedelic journey and long-term meditation practices. And we discuss the rationale behind Sam’s recent decision to close his social media (Twitter) account. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about the higher order functions of the brain, the brain-body connection, consciousness and, of course, meditation and why and how to meditate for maximum benefit.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-sam-harris-using-meditation-to-focus-view-consciousness-and-expand-your-mind/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Sam Harris </p><p>(00:04:54) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:08:54) Sense of Self &amp; Meditation, Dualism of Self</p><p>(00:18:07) Sense of Self in Brain &amp; Body </p><p>(00:25:28) Consciousness vs. Contents, Meditation</p><p>(00:28:25) Interrupting Sense of Self &amp; Attentional Focus, Visual Saccade </p><p>(00:33:30) Observer &amp; Actor, Default Mode Network &amp; Meditation, Blind Spot</p><p>(00:36:52) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:41:57) Mediation &amp; Paths to Understanding Consciousness, Non-Dualistic Experience</p><p>(00:57:32) Sense of Self throughout Evolution </p><p>(01:07:40) Sense of Self from Human Development, Language</p><p>(01:19:46) Internal Dialogue, Distractibility &amp; Mindfulness </p><p>(01:26:27) Time Perception &amp; Mindfulness, Vipassana Meditation, Resistance &amp; Pain</p><p>(01:37:13) Consciousness &amp; Sense of Control, Free Will</p><p>(01:43:14) Authoring Thoughts: Storytelling &amp; Ideas, Free Will</p><p>(01:52:11) Meditation &amp; the Paradoxical Search for Self</p><p>(02:06:44) Meditation &amp; Concentration Practice </p><p>(02:11:58) Mindfulness, “Skylike Mind” &amp; Thoughts</p><p>(02:15:11) States of Self &amp; Context, Dualistic Experiences</p><p>(02:32:39) Distraction &amp; Identification of Thoughts, Meditation &amp; “Flow” States</p><p>(02:42:58) Eyes-Open Meditations, Sense of Self, Visual Cues &amp; Social Interactions</p><p>(02:54:59) Paths to Meditation, Mindfulness Meditation Step-Functions</p><p>(03:05:58) Psychedelics, MDMA &amp; Experiences in Consciousness, Religion</p><p>(03:21:11) Meditation, Psychedelic Journeys &amp; Inner Truths</p><p>(03:29:48) Psilocybin, Ego-Dissolution &amp; Thought Expansion</p><p>(03:40:09) Process vs. Achievement of Goals, Fulfillment in Present</p><p>(03:54:29) Leaving Twitter; Conflict, Life Interruption &amp; Politics </p><p>(04:06:14) Social Media, Attentional Disruption &amp; Deep Work</p><p>(04:15:39) Meditation &amp; Sense of Self</p><p>(04:19:02) Sam Harris &amp; Waking Up App, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Jocko Willink: How to Become Resilient, Forge Your Identity &amp; Lead Others</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/jocko-willink-how-to-become-resilient-forge-your-identity-and-lead-others?utm_campaign=Jocko+Willink%3A+How+to+Become+Resilient%2C+Forge+Your+Identity+%26+Lead+Others&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>My guest is Jocko Willink, a retired Navy SEAL officer and author of multiple books on effective leadership and teamwork, self-discipline and mindset, and host of the Jocko Podcast. We discuss how people can build and sculpt their identity and psychology through specific mindsets and actions and how to adapt the self to novel and challenging situations, using specific daily routines. We consider how “energy” actually stems from physical action and describe practical tools and scientific mechanisms for leveraging exercise, cold exposure, nutrition, fasting, hydration, sunlight, mindset and music to make us feel more energized and what that, in turn, does for our life. Jocko explains how discipline and specific daily routines allow for productivity and creativity. And we discuss the qualities of successful leaders, including how to build confidence and real bonds when working with a team or family/friends. Jocko describes a particularly powerful tool of using perspective shifts to allow for ‘detachment’ as a unique way to identify novel solutions to problems. We also discuss the power of early developmental narratives and how experiences of friendship, love, connection and loss can serve as pillars for making us better human beings in all aspects of life. Our conversation covers a wide range of topics, including mental health, physical health and performance, and provides actionable tools that anyone, regardless of age or profession, can apply to live a more effective and meaningful life.

      <title>The Science of Creativity &amp; How to Enhance Creative Innovation</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-creativity-and-how-to-enhance-creative-innovation</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how the brain engages in creative thinking and, based on that mechanistic understanding, the tools to improve one’s ability to think creatively and innovate in any area. I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation &amp; non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I explain how the brain engages in creative thinking and, based on that mechanistic understanding, the tools to improve one’s ability to think creatively and innovate in any area. I discuss how convergent and divergent thinking are essential for generating creative ideas and provide three types of meditation tools (open monitoring meditation, focused attention meditation &amp; non-sleep deep rest; NSDR), which improve our ability to engage in these creative thinking patterns in specific and powerful ways. I also discuss how dopamine and mood contribute to the creative process and describe behavioral, nutritional and supplementation-based approaches for increasing dopamine to engage in creative thought and implementation. I explain how movement and storytelling (narrative) approaches can generate novel creative ideas and how substances like alcohol, cannabis, and psilocybin impact our creative ability. Excitingly, creativity is a skill that can be cultivated and enhanced; this episode outlines many tools to help anyone access creativity and apply creative patterns of thought to different domains of life.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-creativity-and-how-to-enhance-creative-innovation">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Creativity</p><p>(00:04:47) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT, Waking Up</p><p>(00:08:51) What is Creativity?</p><p>(00:11:16) Creativity in Visual Arts, Escher &amp; Banksy</p><p>(00:23:37) Neural Circuits of Creativity</p><p>(00:27:54) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:33:13) Creative Ideas &amp; Divergent Thinking</p><p>(00:42:09) Testing Creative Ideas &amp; Convergent Thinking</p><p>(00:46:41) Dopamine, Convergent &amp; Divergent Thinking Pathways</p><p>(00:58:06) Tool: Open Monitoring Meditation &amp; Divergent Thinking</p><p>(01:07:38) Tool: Focused Attention Meditation &amp; Convergent Thinking</p><p>(01:11:06) Mood, Creativity &amp; Dopamine</p><p>(01:16:00) Tool: Mood Calibrating, Caffeine &amp; Dopamine</p><p>(01:23:41) Dopamine Supplementation; L-Tyrosine, Caffeine</p><p>(01:30:15) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest, Mesocortical Dopamine &amp; Divergent Thinking</p><p>(01:43:13) Serotonin, Psylocibin &amp; Creative Thinking</p><p>(01:49:13) Alcohol &amp; Autobiographical Scripting; Cannabis</p><p>(01:52:04) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) &amp; Creativity</p><p>(01:54:45) Tool: Movement &amp; Divergent Thinking</p><p>(02:01:02) Tool: Narratives &amp; Storytelling for Creativity</p><p>(02:14:47) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Kyle Gillett: Tools for Hormone Optimization in Males</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-kyle-gillett-tools-for-hormone-optimization-in-males</link>
      <description>My guest is Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health. We discuss how to optimize male hormones using a range of nutritional and behavioral tools, exercise, and supplementation (including discussions on tongkat ali, fadogia agrestis, creatine, peptides and more). We explain how puberty and aging affect hormone levels, how to use bloodwork to monitor hormone levels, how hormone health impacts fertility, libido, hair loss, and prostate health, and describe behaviors that negatively impact testosterone levels. We also discuss how to approach prescription hormone therapies, including which biomarkers to monitor when using these approaches and how to optimize synergistic hormones (e.g., growth hormone and thyroid hormone) to support complete hormone health safely and rationally. Dr. Gillett offers numerous actionable tools that can be tailored to specific goals and age ranges to attain and maintain optimal levels of male hormones for overall health, well-being and longevity.

      <title>AMA #2: Improve Sleep, Reduce Sugar Cravings, Optimal Protein Intake, Stretching Frequency &amp; More</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the second Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of the Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

(00:00:00) Introduction
(00:00:54) Are there any science-backed protocols to increase deep sleep?
(00:28:11) Huberman Lab Premium
In the full 1.5 hour AMA episode, we discuss:

What is your studying routine?

What's the ideal amount of protein intake?

Any tips to eliminate sugar cravings?

What can we do when we wake up early in the morning before the sun is up and can’t benefit from direct sunlight exposure?

Is it better to do shorter bouts of dynamic stretching more frequently throughout the day or longer bouts but multiple times per week?

First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the <a href="https://www.tiny.foundation/">Tiny Foundation</a>.</p><p>Subscribe to Huberman Lab Premium at <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/premium">https://hubermanlab.com/premium</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction</p><p>(00:00:54) Are there any science-backed protocols to increase deep sleep?</p><p>(00:28:11) Huberman Lab Premium</p><p>In the full 1.5 hour AMA episode, we discuss:</p><ul>

      <title>Using Caffeine to Optimize Mental &amp; Physical Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-caffeine-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how to use caffeine to enhance mental and physical health and performance, including the optimal dosages and intake schedules for caffeine. I explain how caffeine powerfully reinforces the consumption of certain foods and drinks—thereby increasing how much we like their tastes and seek them out. I discuss the mechanisms by which caffeine increases focus, alertness and mood and reduces sleepiness. I also explain many practical tools for caffeine use, including delaying caffeine intake after waking, intermittent caffeine use, during fasting, before and during exercise, and the use of theanine to curb jitters caused by caffeine. I also discuss the positive effects of caffeine on overall health and longevity and address several myths about caffeine. Since caffeine is one of the most commonly used substances (more than 90% of adults use caffeine daily!), this episode provides actionable tips for adjusting caffeine consumption to positively impact performance and health, including sleep.

      <title>Dr. Lex Fridman: Navigating Conflict, Finding Purpose &amp; Maintaining Drive</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-lex-fridman-navigating-conflict-finding-purpose-and-maintaining-drive/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Lex Fridman, Ph.D., a Research Scientist at the Massachusetts Institute for Technology (MIT), an expert on artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, and the host of the Lex Fridman Podcast. We discuss Lex’s recent trip to the heart of the Ukrainian-Russian War, geopolitics, perspectives on people living in war zones, the shared human experience, and how information is communicated and controlled. As an experienced podcaster and public educator, Dr. Fridman offers unique insights into the art of holding conversations that grow understanding, especially when they involve people with opposing viewpoints. We also discuss the peer-review process for scientific research publications and how social media and podcasts are evolving the way science and technology are communicated. We consider how to find and follow your life’s purpose, maintain ongoing motivation and implement support systems to build and sustain momentum. Our conversation also covers capitalism, masculinity, chess and cheating, Lex’s idea for an AI robotics start-up and a Q&amp;A from audience questions solicited on social media. As one of the main inspirations for the Huberman Lab podcast, hosting Dr. Fridman for this special centennial episode was an honor and a pleasure!

      <title>Dr. Chris Palmer: Diet &amp; Nutrition for Mental Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-chris-palmer-diet-nutrition-for-mental-health/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Chris Palmer, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.

      <itunes:summary>My guest this episode is Chris Palmer, M.D., a board-certified psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He explains the important connection between nutrition, metabolism and mental health and his pioneering work using the ketogenic diet to successfully treat patients with various mental illnesses, including depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Palmer explains how the ketogenic diet is an evidenced-based treatment for epilepsy, mimics the fasted state and can offset the cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s. He describes the key roles of mitochondria in mental health, how certain conditions likely arise from mitochondrial dysfunction, and how low-carbohydrate diets increase mitochondrial turnover to improve mental health. He also explains how low-carbohydrate diets positively impact the gut microbiome and weight loss, important risk factors for mitochondrial health such as marijuana and alcohol, and the best way to increase circulating ketones depending on individual needs. We also cover how a ketogenic diet impacts mood, sleep, and fertility. Dr. Palmer’s work stands as a revolutionary approach to mental health and disease that, given the prevalence of mental health challenges, should be of interest to people of all backgrounds and ages.

      <title>Science-Based Tools for Increasing Happiness </title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/science-based-tools-for-increasing-happiness/</link>
      <description>I explain the science of happiness, including the different types of happiness and how our actions, circumstances and mindset control them. While it is difficult to standardize happiness from one person to the next, I outline a structured framework of what is critical to increasing your innate “natural happiness,” including financial security, purposeful work and relationships, and I explain specific tools to increase internal happiness (so-called “synthetic happiness”). I review how specific types of human connection and attention to our choices (or lack thereof) can increase or undermine our level of happiness. I also discuss the importance of certain types of physical contact, gratitude, financial choices and volunteer contributions that research shows can maximize happiness. And I discuss how factors such as children, pets, physical well-being, substance use, prior traumas and life-phase milestones affect our quest for and depth of happiness.

      <title>Dr. Layne Norton: The Science of Eating for Health, Fat Loss &amp; Lean Muscle</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-layne-norton-the-science-of-eating-for-health-fat-loss-and-lean-muscle/</link>
      <description>My guest is Layne Norton, Ph.D. — one of the world’s foremost experts in nutrition, protein metabolism, muscle gain and fat loss. We discuss the science of energy utilization and balance, the efficacy of different diets (e.g., ketogenic, vegan, vegetarian, carnivore, omnivore), and how best to build lean muscle mass and lose fat. We also discuss optimal protein and fiber intake, the best sources of protein, the correlation between appetite, satiety signals and exercise, along with male and female-specific needs. Dr. Norton also explains how to support a healthy gut microbiome and offers insight into sugar and artificial sweeteners, processed, cooked, and raw foods, supplements, seed oils, and the relationship of LDL/HDL levels to cardiovascular health. This episode serves as a master class in nutrition, metabolism and exercise and is sure to benefit people of all ages and with different health and fitness goals.

      <title>AMA #1: Leveraging Ultradian Cycles, How to Protect Your Brain, Seed Oils Examined and More</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/premium</link>
      <description>Welcome to a preview of the first Ask Me Anything (AMA) episode, part of Huberman Lab Premium subscription.
The Huberman Lab Premium subscription was launched for two main reasons. First, it was launched in order to raise support for the standard Huberman Lab podcast channel — which will continue to come out every Monday at zero-cost. Second, it was launched as a means to raise funds for important scientific research. A significant portion of proceeds from the Huberman Lab Premium subscription will fund human research (not animal models) selected by Dr. Huberman, with a dollar-for-dollar match from the Tiny Foundation.

      <title>How Meditation Works &amp; Science-Based Effective Meditations </title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-meditation-works-and-science-based-effective-meditations/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.

      <title>Dr. Eddie Chang: The Science of Learning &amp; Speaking Languages</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-eddie-chang-the-science-of-learning-and-speaking-languages/</link>
      <description>My guest is Eddie Chang, MD, a neurosurgeon and professor of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the co-director of the Center for Neural Engineering &amp; Prostheses. We discuss the brain mechanisms underlying speech, language learning and comprehension, communicating human emotion with words and hand gestures, bilingualism and language disorders, such as stuttering. Dr. Chang also explains his work developing and applying state-of-the-art technology to decode speech and using that information and artificial intelligence (AI) to successfully restore communication to patients who have suffered paralyzing injuries or “locked in syndrome.” We also discuss his work treating patients with epilepsy. Finally, we consider the future: how modern neuroscience is overturning textbook medical books, the impact of digital technology such as smartphones on language and the future of natural and computer-assisted human communication.

      <title>Fitness Toolkit: Protocol &amp; Tools to Optimize Physical Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/fitness-toolkit-protocol-and-tools-to-optimize-physical-health/</link>
      <description>I describe a fitness protocol that maximizes all the major sought-after aspects of physical fitness, including strength, endurance and flexibility. I discuss fundamentals of resistance training protocols, including repetitions, sets, inter-set and inter-workout rest periods and periodization of intensity and volume to improve strength and hypertrophy. I also explain how to integrate this with endurance training across the week by controlling the duration, timing and intensity of cardiovascular workouts. I also cover science-based protocols on leveraging the mind-body connection, deliberate breathing (during and after exercise), stretching, deliberate heat and cold exposure, and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) for better workout performance and faster recovery. Further, I tackle a range of real-world issues that can affect a consistent training schedule, such as whether you should train if you are sick, have had a poor night of sleep or had a stressful event and how to start training again after a break and whether you should train in a fasted or fed state. Physical fitness is a key variable for immediate and long-term health. This episode provides a modifiable “foundational” template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment.

This episode provides a modifiable “foundational” template that can be adjusted based on your current fitness level, goals, time constraints, and access to different types of equipment.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/fitness-toolkit-protocol-and-tools-to-optimize-physical-health/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Foundational Protocol for Fitness</p><p>(00:04:35) Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization &amp; Metabolism</p><p>(00:13:49) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:18:53) Core Principles of Fitness &amp; Modifiable Variables</p><p>(00:23:37) Day 1: Long Endurance Workout</p><p>(00:34:38) Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength &amp; Hypertrophy</p><p>(00:36:13) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:39:22) Key Principles of Resistance Training</p><p>(00:51:10) Day 3: Heat &amp; Cold Exposure, Recovery</p><p>(01:00:35) Day 4: Torso &amp; Neck Resistance Training</p><p>(01:09:55) Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives</p><p>(01:16:43) Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate</p><p>(01:24:10) Day 7: Arms, Neck &amp; Calves Resistance Training</p><p>(01:28:45) Flexibility of Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing</p><p>(01:33:00) Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs </p><p>(01:37:10) Safety &amp; Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts</p><p>(01:38:32) Tool: Stress or Poor Sleep &amp; Workouts, Recovery &amp; NSDR</p><p>(01:41:20) Should You Train Fasted or Fed?</p><p>(01:43:58) Tool: Static Stretching &amp; Flexibility, Irradiation &amp; Resistance Training</p><p>(01:49:10) Tool: Hanging from a Bar &amp; Fitness Metric </p><p>(01:50:16) Should You Train Sick?, Ramping Training</p><p>(01:53:33) Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing &amp; Recovery</p><p>(01:55:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Huberman Lab Premium, Neural Network Newsletter, Social Media</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Nolan Williams: Psychedelics &amp; Neurostimulation for Brain Rewiring</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-nolan-williams-psychedelics-and-neurostimulation-for-brain-rewiring</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Nolan Williams, M.D., a triple board-certified psychiatrist, neurologist and professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. He is also the Director of the Stanford Brain Stimulation Lab. We discuss clinical applications for brain stimulation, behavioral protocols and novel drug treatments to halt and reverse mental health disorders, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We first discuss the neural circuits for self-identity and mood and stress control. We discuss Dr. Williams’ work using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to depression, trauma, PTSD, and other mood disorders. We then dive deep into the history, biology, modern use, and safety margins of the various psychedelics, including MDMA, LSD, ketamine, ibogaine, ayahuasca, and psilocybin, as well as cannabis and the use of SSRIs in both adults and children. Finally, we discuss behavioral treatments for mental health disorders, including sleep and sleep deprivation, light exposure, exercise, and training to control the brain-heart-rate pathways. Regardless of age, all those interested in mental health should benefit from the incredible breadth and depth of Dr. Williams’ knowledge and the clarity with which he conveys that information.

      <title>The Effects of Cannabis (Marijuana) on the Brain &amp; Body</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss cannabis (aka marijuana), including the biological mechanisms underlying its effects on the mind and body, its known medical applications, its impact on libido, creativity, hunger, hormones and more. I also cover the known adverse health consequences of chronic and even acute (one-time) use and the factors that determine if cannabis is helpful or harmful. Additionally, I detail how the various strains of cannabis: sativa, indica and hybrid strains, can produce such divergent effects depending on the strain type, THC-to-CBD ratio, total dosage, and frequency of use. I review why cannabis can impact speech patterns and one’s propensity to develop anxiety/depression during and after use and, in some individuals, paranoia. As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.

As the legal landscape for cannabis is rapidly evolving, this episode should interest a wide audience, including former/current cannabis users, those in the medical, sports, law enforcement, and educational communities and, of course, children, teenagers, and parents.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Cannabis (Marijuana)</p><p>(00:005:02) Sponsor: LMNT</p><p>(00:07:03) Tool: Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR), Sleep &amp; Anxiety</p><p>(00:15:08) Cannabis Strains, Psychoactive Compounds: THC &amp; CBD</p><p>(00:19:34) Sativa vs. Indica, Stimulant vs. Relaxation Effects</p><p>(00:25:55) Hybrid Cannabis Strains, Type 1, 2 &amp; 3 Strains</p><p>(00:31:56) Naturally Occurring Receptors: Nicotinic &amp; Cannabinoid Receptors (CB1)</p><p>(00:35:18) Sponsor: AG1</p><p>(00:40:35) THC, CBD vs. Endogenous Cannabinoids, Dependence</p><p>(00:43:14) Endogenous Cannabinoids, Cannabinoid Receptors &amp; Nervous System Function</p><p>(00:53:07) Biological Effects of Cannabis</p><p>(00:56:29) Cannabis Sativa &amp; Subjective Effects: Mood, Stress, Alertness, Paranoia</p><p>(01:04:58) Cannabis Indica &amp; Subjective Effects, Memory, Dosage</p><p>(01:09:41) Brain Areas Affected by THC &amp; CBD, Side Effects</p><p>(01:16:08) Creativity: Convergent vs. Divergent Thinking &amp; Dopamine</p><p>(01:26:41) Does Cannabis Increase Creativity?</p><p>(01:35:08) Chronic Cannabis Use &amp; Changes in Speech Patterns</p><p>(01:46:46) Cannabis &amp; Libido, Dopamine &amp; Prolactin</p><p>(01:56:55) Cannabis &amp; Hormones: Prolactin, Testosterone, Estrogen &amp; Fertility</p><p>(02:06:53) Smoking/Vaping Tobacco or Cannabis &amp; Negative Health Consequences</p><p>(02:10:06) Avoiding Cannabis During Pregnancy/Breastfeeding, Fetal Neural Development</p><p>(02:18:13) Negative Health Consequences of Cannabis, Anxiety &amp; Depression, Tolerance</p><p>(02:25:57) Cannabis Use &amp; Adolescence/Young Adulthood, Predisposition to Psychosis</p><p>(02:34:36) Adolescent Cannabis Use: Brain Development &amp; Mental Health Disorders</p><p>(02:41:44) Cannabis &amp; Pain Management, Divergent Effects of Cannabis</p><p>(02:44:54) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Huberman Lab Premium, Momentous Supplements, Neural Network Newsletter, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Casey Halpern: Biology &amp; Treatments for Compulsive Behaviors &amp; Binge Eating</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-casey-halpern-biology-and-treatments-for-compulsive-eating-and-behaviors/</link>
      <description>My guest is Casey Halpern, M.D., Chief of Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery and Professor of Neurosurgery at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Halpern’s research and clinical practice focus on using deep brain stimulation to treat compulsive and movement disorders (e.g., binge eating disorders, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Parkinson’s disease essential tremor, dystonia). We discuss using deep brain stimulation to help patients who suffer from movement and compulsive disorders and applying this treatment to patients afflicted with binge eating. We also explore applications of this technology to other conditions such as OCD, anorexia and tremor, and the future therapeutic directions of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation approaches, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and ultrasound, for the treatment of other psychiatric illnesses and conditions. This episode will interest those curious about the biology of eating, anorexia, bulimia, compulsive thoughts and behaviors, and movement.

      <title>Nicotine’s Effects on the Brain &amp; Body &amp; How to Quit Smoking or Vaping </title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/nicotines-effects-on-the-brain-and-body-and-how-to-quit-smoking-or-vaping/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain how nicotine impacts the brain and body, including its potent ability to enhance attention, focus, and alertness, increase blood pressure and metabolism and reduce appetite. I discuss nicotine’s ability to increase the action of neurochemicals, including dopamine, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine and activate sympathetic (alertness-promoting) neural circuits. I also discuss common nicotine delivery methods, such as cigarettes, vaping, dip, and snuff, and how they each create their own unique experience and how they, but not nicotine itself, cause cancer and other adverse health effects. I also explain science-based tools to permanently quit smoking cigarettes or vaping, including peer-reviewed clinical hypnosis tools, antidepressants, and alternative nicotine replacement (patches, lozenges, gums etc.). As nicotine is one of the most widely used substances with billions of users — most of whom report wanting to quit — this episode ought to be of interest to former/current nicotine users, those who want to quit smoking or vaping and/or those interested in learning the biology behind how nicotine impacts the brain and body.

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-anderson-the-biology-of-aggression-mating-and-arousal/</link>
      <description>My guest is David Anderson, PhD, a world expert in the science of sexual behavior, violent aggression, fear and other motivated states. Dr. Anderson is a Professor of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a member of the National Academy of Sciences and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). We discuss how states of mind (and body) arise and persist and how they probably better explain human behavior than emotions per se. We also discuss the many kinds of arousal that create varying levels of pressure for certain behaviors to emerge. We discuss different types of violent aggression and how they are impacted by biological sex, gender, context, prior experience, and hormones, and the neural interconnectedness of fear, aggression and sexual behavior. We also discuss peptides and their role in social isolation-induced anxiety and aggression. Dr. Anderson also describes novel, potentially powerful therapeutics for mental health. This episode should interest anyone wanting to learn more about mental health, human emotions, sexual and/or violent behavior.

      <title>Focus Toolkit: Tools to Improve Your Focus &amp; Concentration</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/focus-toolkit-tools-to-improve-your-focus-and-concentration/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I provide a list of behavioral, nutritional, and supplement-based tools you can use to improve your ability to get into a focused state to do mental or physical work. I explain science-supported strategies for transitioning into focus, maintaining focus during the work bout, and exiting the focus session, which is also critical, including decompression/defocusing tools. I explain when and how to use: binaural beats, caffeine, deliberate cold exposure, the pros and cons of working in fasted vs. fed states, and supplements and foods that enhance dopamine, epinephrine (i.e., adrenaline) and acetylcholine to promote optimal focus. Also, I explain how short behavioral practices, such as meditation and visual gaze training, will benefit your ability to focus over the long term. As deep focus is crucial to significantly improve cognitive or physical performance in any realm, this episode should be useful to anyone. By the end, you’ll have an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost focus and concentration strategies to select from that can be tailored to your physical and mental performance needs.

      <itunes:summary>Recently I had the pleasure of hosting two live events, one in Seattle, WA and one in Portland, OR. These events were part of a lecture series called The Brain Body Contract. My favorite part of each evening was the question &amp; answer period, where I had the opportunity to answer questions from the attendees of each event. Included here is the Q&amp;A from our event at the Newmark Theatre.

      <title>Dr. Erich Jarvis: The Neuroscience of Speech, Language &amp; Music</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-erich-jarvis-the-neuroscience-of-speech-language-and-music/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Erich Jarvis, PhD—Professor and the Head of the Laboratory of Neurogenetics of Language at Rockefeller University and Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). Dr. Jarvis’ research spans the molecular and genetic mechanisms of vocal communication, comparative genomics of speech and language across species and the relationship between speech, language and movement. We discuss the unique ability of humans (and certain animal species) to learn and communicate using complex language, including verbal speech production and the ability to interpret both written and spoken language. We also discuss the connections between language, singing and dance and why song may have evolved before language. Dr. Jarvis also explains some of the underlying biological and genetic components of stutter/speech disorders, non-verbal communication, why it's easiest to learn a language as a child and how individuals can learn multiple languages at any age. This episode ought to be of interest to everyone interested in the origins of human speech, language, music and culture and how newer technology, such as social media and texting, change our brains.

      <title>What Alcohol Does to Your Body, Brain &amp; Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-brain-health</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the physiological effects that drinking alcohol has on the brain and body at different levels of consumption and over time. I also describe genetic differences that predispose certain individuals to alcoholism, binge and habit-drinking. I explain alcohol metabolism in simple terms and how it effectively acts as a poison, leading to cellular stress and damage. I then explain that it impacts neuronal function and changes our thinking and behavior – hallmarks of inebriation. I also discuss how alcohol consumption of different amounts impacts inflammation, stress, neurodegeneration, and cancer risk and negatively impacts the gut microbiome, brain thickness, hormone balance, mood and feelings of motivation. Additionally, I discuss the biology of hangovers and describe science-based strategies to mitigate the severity of a hangover. Since alcohol is one of the most widely consumed recreational substances, this episode ought to be of relevance to everyone.  Indeed, even low-to-moderate alcohol consumption negatively impacts the brain and body in direct ways. The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals.

The goal of this episode is to help people make informed decisions about their alcohol consumption that are in keeping with their mental and physical health goals. </p><p>Access the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-brain-health">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><p>Use <a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/93GBd5L-">Ask Huberman Lab</a>, our new AI-powered platform, for a summary, clips, and insights from this episode.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Effects of Alcohol Consumption</p><p>00:03:19 Low to Moderate Alcohol Consumption &amp; Neurodegeneration</p><p>00:06:14 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT</p><p>00:10:46 Historical Context &amp; Uses of Alcohol</p><p>00:13:28 Alcohol Metabolism, “Empty Calories”</p><p>00:18:23 Inebriation: Top-Down Inhibition, Impulsivity &amp; Memory Formation</p><p>00:24:23 Long-Lasting Effects &amp; Impulsivity, Neuroplasticity &amp; Reversibility</p><p>00:27:55 Food &amp; Alcohol Absorption</p><p>00:30:07 Alcohol &amp; Serotonin, SSRIs &amp; Depression, Risk for Alcoholism, Blackouts</p><p>00:37:39 Predisposition for Alcoholism; Chronic Consumption, Cortisol &amp; Stress</p><p>00:43:29 Sponsor: AG1</p><p>00:46:07 Genetic Predisposition for Alcoholism, Consuming Alcohol Too Young</p><p>00:52:27 Gut-Liver-Brain Axis: Alcohol, Gut Microbiome, Inflammation &amp; Leaky Gut</p><p>00:59:46 Tool: Improving/Replenishing Gut Microbiome</p><p>01:02:44 Reducing Alcohol Consumption &amp; Stress</p><p>01:04:25 Hangover: Alcohol &amp; Sleep, Anxiety, Headache</p><p>01:12:11 Hangover Recovery, Adrenaline &amp; Deliberate Cold Exposure</p><p>01:17:16 Hangover Recovery, Dehydration &amp; Electrolytes</p><p>01:20:45 Types of Alcohol &amp; Hangover Severity, Congeners</p><p>01:25:25 Alcohol Tolerance, Dopamine &amp; Serotonin, Pleasure-Pain Balance</p><p>01:33:36 Are There Any Positive Effects of Alcohol?, Resveratrol</p><p>01:35:42 Alcohol &amp; Brain Thickness</p><p>01:37:11 Alcohol &amp; Cancer Risk: DNA Methylation, Breast Cancer Risk</p><p>01:44:31 Mitigating Cancer Risk, Folate, B Vitamins</p><p>01:46:54 Alcohol &amp; Pregnancy, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</p><p>01:50:58 Hormones: Testosterone &amp; Estrogen Balance</p><p>01:55:09 Negative Effects of Alcohol Consumption</p><p>01:58:35 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter, Huberman Lab Clips</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>LIVE EVENT Q&amp;A: Dr. Andrew Huberman at the Moore Theatre in Seattle</title>

      <description>Recently I had the pleasure of hosting two live events, one in Seattle, WA and one in Portland, OR. These events were part of a lecture series called The Brain Body Contract. My favorite part of each evening was the question &amp; answer period, where I had the opportunity to answer questions from the attendees of each event. Included here is the Q&amp;A from our event in Seattle, Washington at the Moore Theatre.

      <title>Dr. Peter Attia: Exercise, Nutrition, Hormones for Vitality &amp; Longevity</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-peter-attia-exercise-nutrition-hormones-for-vitality-and-longevity/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Peter Attia, M.D., who trained at Stanford University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Hospital and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Dr. Attia is host of The Drive podcast and is a world expert on behavioral approaches, nutritional interventions, supplementation and pharmacological techniques to improve lifespan, healthspan and athletic performance. We discuss how best to evaluate your health status using routine blood work, body scans and regular tests of physical strength and endurance. Dr. Attia explains what he uses with his patients to “back-cast” their health goals as a way to design their exercise and nutritional programs. We also discuss hormone modulation and replacement therapy for both men and women. We explain how cholesterol and related factors contribute to cardiovascular disease risk and how to monitor and mitigate that risk. Dr. Attia details various supplementation, nutrition, exercise and prescription approaches useful to people in every decade of life to improve vitality, reduce their risk of disease and increase the number of years sustaining peak cognitive and physical health.

      <title>Sleep Toolkit: Tools for Optimizing Sleep &amp; Sleep-Wake Timing</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe a comprehensive toolkit consisting of behavioral and supplement-based tools that you can customize to enhance the quality, duration and impact of your sleep. This has an enormous positive impact on your overall health and daytime functioning, brain, hormones and immune system. I teach you how to effectively harness light (and darkness), temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital devices in order to fall asleep faster, stay deeply asleep longer and overall, and achieve better quality sleep. I also describe how these tools can be modified to recover quickly from a poor night’s sleep, jet lag or bouts of shift work. Given that sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance, this episode should benefit everyone as it provides an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost strategies that can be tailored to optimize your sleep routine.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I describe a comprehensive toolkit consisting of behavioral and supplement-based tools that you can customize to enhance the quality, duration and impact of your sleep. This has an enormous positive impact on your overall health and daytime functioning, brain, hormones and immune system. I teach you how to effectively harness light (and darkness), temperature, food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, and digital devices in order to fall asleep faster, stay deeply asleep longer and overall, and achieve better quality sleep. I also describe how these tools can be modified to recover quickly from a poor night’s sleep, jet lag or bouts of shift work. Given that sleep is the foundation of all mental health, physical health and performance, this episode should benefit everyone as it provides an essential toolkit of science-supported, low- to zero-cost strategies that can be tailored to optimize your sleep routine.

      <title>Dr. Emily Balcetis: Tools for Setting &amp; Achieving Goals</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-emily-balcetis-tools-for-setting-and-achieving-goals/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Emily Balcetis, PhD, Professor of Psychology at New York University (NYU). Dr. Balcetis’ research focuses on how our perception of the world, particularly our visual perceptions, influences our level and persistence of motivation, how we conceptualize goals, actual goal achievement, and our emotional state as we pursue goals. Dr. Balcetis explains how to best visualize and overcome challenges in pursuit of larger, complex goals. We also discuss the science of how to define goals and intermediate milestones, overcome obstacles, and effectively track progress. This episode highlights science-based, immediately actionable tools that anyone can use to set and achieve physical and/or cognitive goals more effectively.

      <title>The Science &amp; Treatment of Bipolar Disorder</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biology, symptoms, causes and types of bipolar disorder (sometimes called bipolar depression). I discuss neuroplasticity and how the brain normally regulates mood, energy, and perceptions; then, I contrast that with the biology of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by extremes of energy and mood, e.g., mania and depression. I outline the mechanisms through which bipolar disorder manifests in the brain, including deficits of interoception and reduced connections between the parietal and limbic systems. I also outline how treatment options (such as lithium) work in part through homeostatic plasticity.’ I discuss not only lithium but also the treatment of bipolar with ketamine, different talk therapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and nutraceuticals, including Omega-3 and Inositol supplementation. This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.

This episode should interest anyone who has or knows someone with bipolar disorder and, more broadly, those interested in how the brain works to create a balance between thoughts, energy levels, focus, and mood.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-bipolar-disorder/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Bipolar Disorder</p><p>(00:03:42) Tool: Appetite Suppression &amp; GLP-1, Parallel Pathways, Yerba Mate</p><p>(00:9:19) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT</p><p>(00:14:24) Prevalence &amp; Severity of Bipolar Disorder</p><p>(00:16:30) Bipolar Disorder I, Diagnostic Criteria of Mania</p><p>(00:28:58) Bipolar Disorder II, Individual Variability</p><p>(00:33:07) Bipolar I vs. Bipolar II: Manic, Depressive &amp; Symptom-Free States</p><p>(00:38:20) Consequences of Bipolar Disorder, Heritability</p><p>(00:46:53) Bipolar Disorder vs. Borderline Personality Disorder</p><p>(00:51:51) Mania &amp; Depression, Negative Impacts</p><p>(00:53:06) History of Lithium Treatment</p><p>(01:02:44) Lithium Treatment &amp; Side-Effects</p><p>(01:05:05) Effects of Lithium: BDNF, Anti-inflammatory &amp; Neuroprotection</p><p>(01:10:10) Neural Circuits of Bipolar Disorder, Interoception, Hyper- vs. Hypoactivity</p><p>(01:17:11) Neural States &amp; Mania, Parietal Lobe &amp; Limbic System</p><p>(01:22:58) Homeostatic Plasticity, Synaptic Scaling, Lithium &amp; Ketamine</p><p>(01:36:00) Talk Therapies: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal &amp; Social Rhythm Therapy</p><p>(01:43:18) Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)</p><p>(01:48:01) Psylocibin, Cannabis</p><p>(01:51:50) Lifestyle Support, Supplements: Inositol &amp; Omega-3 Fatty Acids</p><p>(02:03:31) Omega-3s, Membrane Fluidity &amp; Neuroplasticity</p><p>(02:06:44) Mania, Creativity &amp; Occupations</p><p>(02:15:33) Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis, Neural Circuits &amp; Treatment</p><p>(02:17:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Charles Zuker: The Biology of Taste Perception &amp; Sugar Craving</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-charles-zuker-the-biology-of-taste-perception-and-sugar-craving/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Charles Zuker, Ph.D., Professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics and Neuroscience at Columbia University and an Investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Zuker is the world’s leading expert in the biology of taste, thirst and craving. His laboratory explores the mechanisms of taste perception, focusing on how our conscious and unconscious processing of specific foods and nutrients guide our actions and behaviors. We discuss the neural circuits of taste, the “gut-brain axis,” the basis of food cravings and the key difference between wanting (craving) and liking (perceiving) sugar. We also explore how taste perception relates to specific food satiety, thirst, to our emotions, and expectation. We also consider how sugar containing and highly-processed foods can hijack the natural balance of the taste and digestive systems. Dr. Zuker provides a true masterclass in the biology of taste and perception that ought to be of interest to anyone curious about how the brain works, our motivated behaviors and the neural, chemical perceptual aspects of the mind.

      <title>Optimize &amp; Control Your Brain Chemistry to Improve Health &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/optimize-and-control-your-brain-chemistry-to-improve-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biological roles of the four major neuromodulators—dopamine, epinephrine (aka adrenaline), serotonin, and acetylcholine—and describe how these neuromodulators impact a wide variety of mental states and behaviors, including focus, creativity, motivation, drive, learning, alertness, mood, relationships, and feelings of well-being. Then, with that foundational understanding in mind, I describe a potent toolkit of science-supported behavioral, nutrition, and supplementation tools that can be used to increase baseline levels of individual neuromodulators and that can be modified for specific goals. This episode summarizes low-or-no-cost, actionable, science-based tools that can benefit anyone in order to enhance their levels of brain chemicals and improve mental health, physical health, and performance.

      <title>The Science &amp; Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) </title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-treatment-of-obsessive-compulsive-disorder</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the biology and psychology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—a prevalent and debilitating condition. I also discuss the efficacy and mechanisms behind OCD treatments—both behavioral and pharmacologic as well as holistic and combination treatments and new emerging treatments, including directed brain stimulation. I explain the neural circuitry underlying repetitive “thought-action loops” and why in OCD, the compulsive actions merely make the obsessions even stronger. I review cognitive-behavioral therapies like exposure therapy and SSRIs, holistic approaches, and nutraceuticals, detailing the efficacy of each approach and what science says about how to combine and sequence treatments. I describe an often effective approach for treating OCD where clinicians use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to deliberately bring patients into states of high anxiety while encouraging them to suppress compulsive actions in order to help them learn to overcome repetitious thought/action cycles. This episode should interest anyone with OCD, anyone who knows someone with OCD or OCPD, and more generally, those interested in how the brain works to control thoughts and actions, whether those thoughts are intrusive or not.

      <title>Ido Portal: The Science &amp; Practice of Movement</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/ido-portal-the-science-and-practice-of-movement/</link>
      <description>My guest is Ido Portal, the world’s foremost expert on human movement. Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors, and science, to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called “The Ido Portal Method.” Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns, and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills- cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone—children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.

        <![CDATA[<p>My guest is Ido Portal, the world’s foremost expert on human movement. Ido has spent a lifetime studying, combining and evolving elements from an enormous range of martial arts, dance genres, athletic endeavors, and science, to develop a unified theory and practice of movement called “The Ido Portal Method.” Here we discuss all things movement, including the role of the nervous system, reflexive versus deliberate movement patterns, and the link between emotions and awareness in movement. We also discuss learning and neuroplasticity, the mind-body connection and how movement itself can be leveraged toward expanding other types of skills- cognitive, creative and otherwise. As one of the most sought out teachers of movement alive today, the knowledge Ido shares in this conversation can benefit everyone—children, adults, athletes, dancers, clinicians and trainers and the everyday person.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/ido-portal-the-science-and-practice-of-movement/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Ido Portal, Movement &amp; Movement Practice</p><p>(00:03:42) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT</p><p>(00:07:49) What is Movement?</p><p>(00:10:56) Movement &amp; the Body-Mind Connection</p><p>(00:14:47) Entry Points to Movement</p><p>(00:18:08) Early Education in Movement: Awareness, Play &amp; Examination</p><p>(00:21:19) Stillness, Movement &amp; the Environment, Playfulness</p><p>(00:31:34) Unique Postures, Types of Movement, Contents vs. Containers</p><p>(00:40:50) Discomfort: Marker of Movement, Failures &amp; Learning</p><p>(00:47:05) Movement Diversity, Squat Challenge, Injury, Movement Evolution</p><p>(00:56:36) Animal &amp; Human Movements, Gain &amp; Change</p><p>(01:02:04) Core Movement, Emotion &amp; Memory, Spinal Waves, Evolution</p><p>(01:12:39) Song, Dance &amp; Complex Language, Movement as Language, Consilience</p><p>(01:21:39) Movement Culture, Community, Collective Knowledge, Wild &amp; Wise</p><p>(01:26:36) Potential for Movement, “Humming”</p><p>(01:32:18) Instructiveness vs Permissiveness, Degrees of Freedom</p><p>(01:35:50) Variety, Diversity &amp; Virtuosity</p><p>(01:38:06) Vision &amp; Movement, Focus &amp; Awareness, Panoramic Awareness</p><p>(01:48:28) Hearing &amp; Movement</p><p>(01:52:43) Walking Gaits</p><p>(01:56:55) Playful Variability &amp; Evolution, Improvisation &amp; Openness</p><p>(02:03:05) Reactivity &amp; Personal Space, Touch &amp; Proximity to Others, Play &amp; Discomfort</p><p>(02:18:13) Visualization &amp; Experience, Feedback</p><p>(02:20:14) Linear Movement &amp; Movement Investigation, Examination</p><p>(02:31:45) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Momentous Supplements, Instagram, Twitter, Neural Network Newsletter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Improve Flexibility with Research-Supported Stretching Protocols</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/improve-flexibility-with-research-supported-stretching-protocols</link>
      <description>In this episode, I explain the science behind limb range of motion and flexibility and how to increase them by using science-supported protocols. Flexibility is crucial for physical movements and can help prevent injuries, decrease inflammation, modulate physical and mental pain, impact exercise recovery speed and even potentially slow the progression of certain diseases. I explain the biology of flexibility, including the specific neural mechanisms that sense stretch and load (i.e., tension) on the muscles and limbs, as well as how specific brain regions like the insula combine those signals to ultimately control limb range of movement. I also provide science-based stretching and “micro-stretching” protocols that reliably improve limb flexibility with the minimum necessary time investment. I review all the details of those stretching protocols: how often to do them, for how long, their timing relative to other exercises, sets, the time between sets, measuring progress and more. All people, physically active or not, should benefit from the information and tools described in this episode.

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-paul-conti-therapy-treating-trauma-and-other-life-challenges/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Paul Conti, M.D., a psychiatrist and expert in treating trauma, personality disorders and psychiatric illnesses and challenges of various kinds. Dr. Conti earned his MD at Stanford and did his residency at Harvard Medical School. He now runs the Pacific Premiere Group—a clinical practice helping people heal and grow from trauma and other life challenges. We discuss trauma: what it is and its far-reaching effects on the mind and body, as well as the best treatment approaches for trauma. We also explore how to choose a therapist and how to get the most out of therapy, as well as how to do self-directed therapy. We discuss the positive and negative effects of antidepressants, ADHD medications, alcohol, cannabis, and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics (e.g., psilocybin and LSD), ketamine and MDMA. This episode is must listen for anyone seeking or already doing therapy, processing trauma, and/or considering psychoactive medication. Both patients and practitioners ought to benefit from the information.

      <title>The Science &amp; Process of Healing from Grief</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-process-of-healing-from-grief/</link>
      <description>This episode, I discuss grief and the challenges of processing losses of different kinds. I explain the biological mechanisms of grief, including how neural circuits for emotional and factual memory combine with those for love and attachment, to create feelings of absence and yearning. I discuss how grief is distinct from depression, yet why they can feel so similar. I also provide science-based tools to assist with the grieving process, including how to reframe and remap the relationship with those we have lost while still maintaining a strong emotional connection to them. I also explain the importance of having and building strong foundational psychological and biological states so that we can better cope with grief when it happens. Finally, I describe tools to adjust those states, including those for accessing sleep, managing stress and emotional swings. This episode is for those suffering from grief but also for everyone, given that we all experience grief at some point in our lives.
We recorded this episode before the recent mass shooting tragedies in the United States. While we hope the information in this episode will be of use to anyone suffering from grief of any kind and at any time, we are also careful to acknowledge that many people require additional support and resources. For that reason, we include mention of such resources and we generally hope people will access them if needed.

      <title>Dr. Wendy Suzuki: Boost Attention &amp; Memory with Science-Based Tools</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-wendy-suzuki-boost-attention-and-memory-with-science-based-tools/</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki, Ph.D., Professor of Neural Science and Psychology and (soon) Dean of New York University, whose research focuses on memory, attention, brain plasticity and simple, daily habits that can be leveraged to improve learning, focus, memory and cognitive ability. We discuss the role of cardiovascular exercise, weight training, deliberate cold exposure, meditation, verbal affirmations, sleep, and other behavioral practices for enhancing learning, mood and stress management, and increasing attention span. Dr. Suzuki shares the mechanisms by which these practices change our brain in order to improve cognitive function fast and reduce age-related cognitive decline.

      <title>Understand &amp; Improve Memory Using Science-Based Tools</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/understand-and-improve-memory-using-science-based-tools/</link>
      <description>This episode I explain the mechanisms by which different types of memories are established in our brain and how to leverage the amount and timing of key neurochemicals and hormones, such as adrenaline (aka epinephrine) and cortisol, to improve your learning and memory abilities. I describe multiple science-based protocols to do this, including repetition, caffeine, emotional states, deliberate cold exposure, sleep, meditation, and the role of vision, including taking “mental snapshots.” I also describe how exercise and an associated hormone, osteocalcin, can improve cognitive ability and memory formation. I also describe unique aspects and forms of memory such as photographic memory, extreme facial recognition (aka super recognition), and the phenomenon known as déjà vu.

      <itunes:summary>This episode I explain the mechanisms by which different types of memories are established in our brain and how to leverage the amount and timing of key neurochemicals and hormones, such as adrenaline (aka epinephrine) and cortisol, to improve your learning and memory abilities. I describe multiple science-based protocols to do this, including repetition, caffeine, emotional states, deliberate cold exposure, sleep, meditation, and the role of vision, including taking “mental snapshots.” I also describe how exercise and an associated hormone, osteocalcin, can improve cognitive ability and memory formation. I also describe unique aspects and forms of memory such as photographic memory, extreme facial recognition (aka super recognition), and the phenomenon known as déjà vu.

      <title>Understanding &amp; Controlling Aggression</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/understanding-and-controlling-aggression/</link>
      <description>This episode I describe the neural mechanisms that activate and control aggressive states and behaviors and the role of hormones—estrogen and testosterone—in mediating violent and and/or competive aggression. I also describe tools that can be used to modulate the factors that have been shown to ‘prime’ an individual for aggression, including sunlight, estrogen sensitivity, competition within social settings, and overall stress levels, and the hormone cortisol. I discuss how substances such as caffeine and alcohol can impact impulsive behaviors, and how nutrition and supplementation can be used to regulate mood and aggression.

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-rhonda-patrick-micronutrients-for-health-and-longevity/</link>
      <description>My guest is Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D. She earned her doctoral degree in biomedical science from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and has become one of the leading public health educators on the brain and general health, aging, cancer, and nutrition. We discuss the four major categories of micronutrients that regulate cellular and organ stress and antioxidants, inflammation, hormone regulation, immune system, and longevity. Dr. Patrick provides actionable protocols for obtaining key micronutrients from food and/or supplement-based sources. Additionally, Dr. Patrick outlines protocols for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure to benefit metabolism, cardiorespiratory fitness, mental health, and lifespan.

        <![CDATA[<p>My guest is Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D. She earned her doctoral degree in biomedical science from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and has become one of the leading public health educators on the brain and general health, aging, cancer, and nutrition. We discuss the four major categories of micronutrients that regulate cellular and organ stress and antioxidants, inflammation, hormone regulation, immune system, and longevity. Dr. Patrick provides actionable protocols for obtaining key micronutrients from food and/or supplement-based sources. Additionally, Dr. Patrick outlines protocols for deliberate cold and deliberate heat exposure to benefit metabolism, cardiorespiratory fitness, mental health, and lifespan. </p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-rhonda-patrick-micronutrients-for-health-and-longevity/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. Rhonda Patrick – Micronutrients, Cold &amp; Heat Exposure </p><p>(00:03:12) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT</p><p>(00:09:42) Stress Response Pathways, Hormesis</p><p>(00:16:38) Plants, Polyphenols, Sulforaphane</p><p>(00:21:12) Tools 1: Sulforaphane - Broccoli Sprouts, Broccoli, Mustard Seed </p><p>(00:23:50) Tool 2: Moringa &amp; Nrf2 Antioxidant Response</p><p>(00:25:25) Sulforaphane: Antioxidants (Glutathione) &amp; Air Pollution (Benzene Elimination) </p><p>(00:27:10) Plants &amp; Stress Response Pathways, Intermittent Challenges </p><p>(00:29:35) Traumatic Brain Injury, Sulforaphane, Nrf2 </p><p>(00:35:08) Tools 3: Omega-3 Fatty Acids (ALA, EPA &amp; DHA), Fish Oil, Oxidation </p><p>(00:48:40) EPA Omega-3s &amp; Depression </p><p>(00:52:02) Krill Oil vs. Fish Oil Supplements? </p><p>(00:54:23) Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Omega-3 Index &amp; Life Expectancy </p><p>(00:59:24) Tool 4: Food Sources of EPA Omega-3s </p><p>(01:06:07) Omega-3 Supplementation, Omega-3 Index Testing</p><p>(01:10:22) Benefits of Omega-3s </p><p>(01:14:40) Tool 5: Food Sources of DHA Omega-3s</p><p>(01:17:07) Vitamin D &amp; Sun Skin Exposure </p><p>(01:22:18) Role of Vitamin D, Gene Regulation </p><p>(01:25:30) Tool 6: Vitamin D Testing &amp; Vitamin D3 Supplementation </p><p>(01:33:15) Tool 7: Skin Surface Area &amp; Sun Exposure, Vitamin D </p><p>(01:34:23) Vitamin D &amp; Longevity</p><p>(01:36:46) Sun Exposure &amp; Sunscreen</p><p>(01:40:30) Role of Magnesium, Magnesium Sources, Dark Leafy Green Vegetables</p><p>(01:44:50) Tool 8: Magnesium Supplements: Citrate, Threonate, Malate, Bisglycinate </p><p>(01:50:57) Tool 9: Deliberate Cold Exposure Protocol &amp; Mood/Anxiety</p><p>(01:59:22) Tool 10: Cold Exposure, Mitochondria UCP1 &amp; Heat Generation</p><p>(02:02:30) Tool 11: Cold &amp; Fat ‘Browning’, PGC-1alpha, Metabolism</p><p>(02:05:08) Cold Exposure &amp; High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), PGC-1alpha, Muscle </p><p>(02:08:04) Tools 12: Exercise, HIIT, Tabata &amp; Sauna </p><p>(02:13:30) Tool 13: Sauna, Endorphins/Dynorphins, Mood </p><p>(02:17:45) Tool 14: Mild Stress, Adrenaline &amp; Memory</p><p>(02:19:53) Sauna, Vasodilation &amp; Alzheimer’s and Dementia Risk </p><p>(02:25:30) Sauna Benefits, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) </p><p>(02:31:29) Insulin signaling, FOXO3 &amp; Longevity </p><p>(02:33:22) Tools 16: Sauna Protocols, Hot Baths &amp; Fertility </p><p>(02:37:41) Tool 17: Exercise &amp; Longevity, Osteocalcin </p><p>(02:41:37) Tools 18: Red Light Sauna?

      <title>The Science &amp; Health Benefits of Deliberate Heat Exposure</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-and-health-benefits-of-deliberate-heat-exposure/</link>
      <description>I describe the mechanisms by which deliberate heat exposure impacts body temperature, metabolism, heart health, hormone production, exercise recovery, cognition, mood, and longevity. I detail specific protocols for deliberate heat exposure, including exposure times, temperature ranges to consider, time of day, and delivery mechanisms (sauna vs. hot bath vs. open air heat, etc.) in order to achieve different specific outcomes, including dramatic growth hormone releases, or reduction in cortisol levels. I also discuss the ability of locally applied heat to heal or otherwise improve various bodily tissues and new data on how local application of heat may induce the conversion of metabolically sluggish white fat to metabolically robust beige fat.

      <title>Using Light (Sunlight, Blue Light &amp; Red Light) to Optimize Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-light-sunlight-blue-light-and-red-light-to-optimize-health</link>
      <description>I describe the mechanisms by which different wavelengths of light impact the cells, tissues and organs of the human body, and how specifically timed light exposure of specific wavelengths can be used to improve sleep, enhance alertness, modulate hormone levels, and improve mood. I also explain the use of ultraviolet and infrared phototherapies to relieve pain increase testosterone and estrogen levels; improve skin health, appearance and wound healing; and how red light can be used to offset age-related vision loss and provide neuroprotection. Throughout the episode, I describe the mechanisms of light-based therapies and actionable tools that people can use positively impact mental and physical health.

      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-optimize-your-hormones-for-health-and-vitality</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. Kyle Gillett, MD, a dual board-certified physician in family medicine and obesity medicine and an expert in optimizing hormone levels to improve overall health and well-being in both men and women. We discuss how to improve hormones using behavioral, nutritional, and exercise-based tools and safely and rationally approach supplementation and hormone therapies. We discuss testosterone and estrogen and how those hormones relate to fertility, mood, aging, relationships, disease pathologies, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, prolactin, dopamine and peptides that impact physical and mental health and vitality across the lifespan. The episode is rich with scientific mechanisms and tools for people to consider.

      <title>Using Deliberate Cold Exposure for Health and Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-deliberate-cold-exposure-for-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>I describe mechanisms by which deliberate cold exposure can enhance mental health, physical health, and performance. I detail specific protocols to safely engage in deliberate cold exposure, including minimal exposure times, time-of-day effects, determining optimal temperatures, recovery, mindset, and movement during cold exposure. I discuss how cold exposure can be used to safely stress the body to improve attention, mood, and cognitive focus and boost metabolism and reduce inflammation. Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.

      <title>Dr. Andy Galpin: How to Build Strength, Muscle Size &amp; Endurance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-andy-galpin-how-to-build-strength-muscle-size-and-endurance</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss fundamental principles of strength and hypertrophy training and building endurance, along with the mechanisms underlying them. Joining me is Dr. Andy Galpin, Professor of Kinesiology at California State University, Fullerton, and one of the foremost experts in the world on the science and application of methods to increase strength, hypertrophy, and endurance performance. We review specific protocols to optimize training and recovery, and also delve into hydration, sleep, nutrition, supplements, and mental tools that can be leveraged to accelerate adaptations leading to enhanced strength, muscle growth, and/or endurance.

      <title>Controlling Sugar Cravings &amp; Metabolism with Science-Based Tools </title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-sugar-cravings-and-metabolism-with-science-based-tools</link>
      <description>I explain how to blunt sugar cravings through fundamental knowledge of how sugar is sensed, metabolized, and utilized within the body. I explain how sugar is processed through the digestive tract and nervous system and how both the taste and nutritive components of sugar can lead to specific appetite changes and cravings. I discuss the connection between sugar, dopamine, and cravings and outline many tools to curb sugar cravings, specifically craving highly processed refined sugars.

      <title>Using Salt to Optimize Mental &amp; Physical Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-salt-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/</link>
      <description>I discuss the role of salt (sodium) in the nervous system and the key role that it plays in mental performance, physical performance and health. I explain how the brain senses salt levels in our body and how that relates to our feelings of thirst. I cover the physiology of the renal system and the hormones that control sodium and water balance in our body. I also explore how salt interacts with stress and our immune systems and its crucial role in neuron function. Additionally, I examine research findings suggesting that some individuals might benefit from increased intake of sodium and other electrolytes (magnesium and potassium) to enhance mental performance, lessen anxiety, and offset dizziness. Yet, other people may need less sodium. I discuss how you can determine your optimal sodium intake and why sodium intake levels need to be uniquely tailored to an individual’s lifestyle. Finally, I explain how salt creates ‘hidden’ sugars in many processed foods and the problems that can create. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed findings outlining salt’s essential role in overall health and describe general recommendations and tools anyone can use to find their optimal salt balance and thereby enhance their brain and body’s performance.

      <title>Dr. Justin Sonnenburg: How to Build, Maintain &amp; Repair Gut Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-justin-sonnenburg-how-to-build-maintain-and-repair-gut-health/</link>
      <description>My guest this episode is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Professor of Microbiology &amp; Immunology at Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.

      <itunes:summary>My guest this episode is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg, Professor of Microbiology &amp; Immunology at Stanford University. Dr. Sonnenburg’s research focuses on how microbes in our gut impact our mental and physical health and how diet and your environment shape your gut microbiome. We discuss the architecture of the gut microbiome and microbiota variability in different regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and how these can change in response to diet, environment or genetics. We explore the early establishment of your microbiome and how your mode of delivery into the world (C-section or not) shapes your gut. We also discuss lifestyle factors that can alter your microbiome and the integral role the gut microbiome plays in communicating to other organs, including your brain. Dr. Sonnenburg details his recent clinical study, which found that diets rich in fermented foods (but not fiber) increase microbiota diversity and reduce signals of inflammation. Additionally, we examine how foods typical in Western Diets (e.g., high fat, low fiber, processed foods) can negatively impact the gut microbiome. Throughout the episode, we discuss actionable tools from peer-reviewed clinical findings that anyone can implement, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their gut microbiome and health.

      <title>How to Enhance Your Gut Microbiome for Brain &amp; Overall Health</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-enhance-your-gut-microbiome-for-brain-and-overall-health/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the profound effect the gut has on the nervous system. I cover the structure and function of the gut-brain axis and the role of the gut microbiome in the brain and overall health. I describe how the gut controls hunger or satiety by affecting neurons in our brain. I also contrast the many pathways by which the gut influences the brain: direct vs. indirect pathways, chemical vs. mechanical, and fast vs. slow signaling. Additionally, I discuss what defines a healthy microbiome and how your lifestyle impacts the gut microbiome, including the effects of stress, fasting, antibiotics, pets, environment, prebiotics and probiotics. I address how different foods shape the gut microbiome, in particular, the emerging data that fermented foods can increase the diversity of healthy gut microbiota. Throughout the episode, I explain peer-reviewed and textbook findings that reveal the critical role of the gut microbiome in supporting mental and physical health and I outline simple tools that anyone can use in order to enhance their gut microbiome health.

      <title>Dr. David Spiegel: Using Hypnosis to Enhance Mental &amp; Physical Health &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-spiegel-using-hypnosis-to-enhance-mental-and-physical-health-and-performance/</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. David Spiegel MD, Associate Chair of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences, Director of the Center on Stress and Health and Director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Spiegel has more than 40 years of clinical and research experience with hypnosis, stress physiology, and psychotherapy. In this episode, we examine the role of clinical hypnosis for the treatment of trauma, chronic pain, anxiety and more. Dr. Spiegel explains how to determine your level of ‘hypnotizability’ and provides case studies of incredible successes with hypnosis to treat a variety of ailments. We also discuss how breathing, vision and directed mental focus can modulate internal states and enhance performance. Additionally, we discuss how the adoption of self-hypnosis techniques can reduce stress and enhance sleep in anyone. Dr. Spiegel teaches us how hypnosis works at the neural circuit level to enhance cognitive flexibility. Throughout the episode, Dr. Spiegel summarizes key clinical trials and peer-reviewed findings and resources to work with a trained clinical professional or to do guided self-hypnosis.

Throughout the episode, Dr. Spiegel summarizes key clinical trials and peer-reviewed findings and resources to work with a trained clinical professional or to do guided self-hypnosis. </p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/dr-david-spiegel-using-hypnosis-to-enhance-mental-and-physical-health-and-performance/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Dr. David Spiegel MD, Hypnosis</p><p>(00:04:20) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT</p><p>(00:09:09) Clinical Hypnosis</p><p>(00:16:45) Stage Hypnosis</p><p>(00:20:25) Neurobiology of Hypnosis</p><p>(00:26:04) ADHD</p><p>(00:28:22) Hypnosis for Stress &amp; Sleep</p><p>(00:32:12) Hypnosis to Strengthen Neural Connections</p><p>(00:37:19) Restructuring Trauma Narratives</p><p>(00:45:14) Ketamine Therapy</p><p>(00:50:07) Self-directed Hypnosis, Reveri</p><p>(00:56:53) Eliminating Obsessive Thoughts, Superstitions</p><p>(01:01:50) ‘Hypnotizability’, the Spiegel Eye-roll Test</p><p>(01:15:36) EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing)</p><p>(01:21:43) Confronting Stress &amp; Trauma</p><p>(01:27:56) The Mind-Body Connection</p><p>(01:31:35) Dealing with Grief</p><p>(01:35:45) Hypnosis in Children &amp; Groups</p><p>(01:40:06) Drug Therapies &amp; Hypnosis</p><p>(01:42:39) Breathing Patterns, Peak Performance</p><p>(01:50:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify &amp; Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>The Science of Love, Desire and Attachment</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-love-desire-and-attachment/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the psychology and biology of desire, love and attachment. I explain how childhood attachment types are thought to inform adult attachment styles to romantic partners, and I describe some of the major theories of human mate selection, relationships and infidelity. Additionally, I explore the neurobiology and proposed subconscious processing underlying desire, love and attachment, including the roles of empathy and “positive delusion." I outline how self-awareness can shift one’s relationship attachment style towards securely bonded partnerships. Finally, I describe specific tools and supplements that have been researched to increase libido and sex drive. Throughout the episode, I explain the science and key mechanisms underlying romantic love and outline tools for those seeking to find a strong, healthy relationship, or for those wanting to strengthen an existing relationship.

      <title>Using Play to Rewire &amp; Improve Your Brain</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/using-play-to-rewire-and-improve-your-brain/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the transformative nature of play—how it changes our feelings, thoughts and actions and indeed, how it can rewire our brain to function better in all contexts. I explain the role of play in childhood, as well as adulthood in skill and social development and describe key characteristics of the mind and body during play. Additionally, I explore how play allows the brain to test contingencies in different roles/environments. Throughout, I discuss the underlying neurobiology of play. I also describe how low-stakes play, and tinkering can broaden and shape your future capabilities. Finally, I discuss how our childhood ‘personal play identity’ informs our adult personality. Throughout the episode, I use the science of play to outline recommendations for using play as a means to enhance neuroplasticity and explore novel situations, regardless of age.

      <title>Optimizing Workspace for Productivity, Focus, &amp; Creativity</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/optimizing-workspace-for-productivity-focus-and-creativity/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss ways to set up your workspace to optimize productivity, focus and creativity. I discuss how to adjust light, physically arrange your work environment, and leverage body posture to enhance productivity. Additionally, I explore how to shift your work environment for particular types of tasks. Moreover, I review the role of body movement in the workspace. I also discuss sound-based tools that can either enhance or diminish cognitive functioning (the ability to focus on deep work). I describe a particular frequency of binaural beats that studies show can be used to enhance memory and recall. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed findings practical tools anyone can use, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their workspace to achieve heightened levels of productivity, increased alertness and focus, and creativity.

I also discuss sound-based tools that can either enhance or diminish cognitive functioning (the ability to focus on deep work). I describe a particular frequency of binaural beats that studies show can be used to enhance memory and recall. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed findings practical tools anyone can use, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their workspace to achieve heightened levels of productivity, increased alertness and focus, and creativity.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/optimizing-workspace-for-productivity-focus-and-creativity/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Arranging Environment for Focus</p><p>(00:02:44) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT</p><p>(00:07:55) How to Increase Focus</p><p>(00:10:02) Lighting Your Work in Phase 1</p><p>(00:16:00) Lighting Your Work in Phase 2</p><p>(00:19:45) Lighting Your Work in Phase 3</p><p>(00:24:17) Where to Look While You Work</p><p>(00:28:02) Arranging Your Environment</p><p>(00:31:24) Body Posture</p><p>(00:34:22) How Long to Do Deep Work</p><p>(00:36:50) Set the Right Visual Window Size</p><p>(00:42:15) 45 min / 5 min Rule</p><p>(00:44:23) The Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work</p><p>(00:55:50) Leveraging Background Noise</p><p>(01:02:20) Binaural Beats for Work</p><p>(01:06:38) The Best Binaural Frequency for Work</p><p>(01:11:17) How Binaural Beats Increase Focus</p><p>(01:13:56) Minimizing Interruptions</p><p>(01:20:01) Sit or Stand, or Both?</p><p>(01:25:18) Movement in the Workspace</p><p>(01:31:00) Summary &amp; Shifting Work Environments</p><p>(01:39:36) Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements</p><p><a href="https://hubermanlab.com/disclaimer/">Disclaimer</a></p>]]>

      <title>Dr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/dr-alia-crum-science-of-mindsets-for-health-performance/</link>
      <description>My guest is Dr. Alia Crum, Associate (tenured) Professor of Psychology at Stanford University and Director of the Stanford Mind &amp; Body Lab. Dr. Crum is a world expert on mindsets and beliefs and how they shape our responses to stress, exercise, and even to the foods we eat. We discuss how our mindset about the nutritional content of food changes whether it is satisfying to us at a physiological (hormonal and metabolic) level. She also tells how mindsets about exercise can dramatically alter the effects of exercise on weight loss, blood pressure, and other health metrics. Dr. Crum teaches us how to think about stress in ways that allow stress to grow us and bring out our best rather than diminish our health and performance. Throughout the episode, Dr. Crum provides descriptions of high-quality peer-reviewed scientific findings that we can all leverage toward better health and performance in our lives.

      <title>The Science of Setting &amp; Achieving Goals</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/the-science-of-setting-and-achieving-goals/</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the science of setting, assessing, and pursuing goals. I explain the neural (brain) circuits that underlie goal setting and pursuit. Then I describe nine science-supported tools anyone can apply toward their goals. I explain when and how to use goal visualization, when to use multitasking and how to use specific rewards to improve the likelihood of reaching your goals. I also explain why envisioning failures and their consequences are effective and how to set goals of the appropriate level of challenge. I also explain how the molecule dopamine is used to gauge our progress toward milestones and long-term overarching goals and how to leverage dopamine for goal pursuit. Finally, I explain a unique tool called 'space-time bridging' that can be used to support all aspects of goal setting, assessment, and pursuit. This episode ought to be useful for anyone seeking to improve their performance in work, school, exercise, athletics, or personal development.

      <title>Dr. Jack Feldman: Breathing for Mental &amp; Physical Health &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-jack-feldman-breathing-for-mental-physical-health-and-performance</link>
      <description>This episode my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman, Distinguished Professor of Neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles and a pioneering world expert in the science of respiration (breathing). We discuss how and why humans breathe the way we do, the function of the diaphragm and how it serves to increase oxygenation of the brain and body. We discuss how breathing influences mental state, fear, memory, reaction time, and more. And we discuss specific breathing protocols such as box-breathing, cyclic hyperventilation (similar to Wim Hof breathing), nasal versus mouth breathing, unilateral breathing, and how these each affect the brain and body. We discuss physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing, and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of "Master Class" on the science of breathing and breathing-related tools for health and performance.

We discuss physiological sighs, peptides expressed by specific neurons controlling breathing, and magnesium compounds that can improve cognitive ability and how they work. This conversation serves as a sort of "Master Class" on the science of breathing and breathing-related tools for health and performance.

      <title>The Science of Making &amp; Breaking Habits</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-making-and-breaking-habits</link>
      <description>In this episode, I review the science of habit formation and habit elimination and how the process of neuroplasticity (brain rewiring) underlies these processes.
I describe two new systems for habit formation. The first system is grounded in the neuroscience of brain states and our ability to perform (and to avoid) certain tasks at different phases of the 24-hour day. The second system focuses on 21-day habit formation and consolidation.
I also discuss "task bracketing" as an approach to enhancing habit formation and eliminating unwanted habits and the neural circuits that underlie task bracketing in the basal ganglia (a brain region for generating and stopping behaviors). I also review the science of dopamine rewards and how to apply that knowledge to shaping habits.
The science and tools in this episode ought to be helpful for anyone looking to build better habits and eliminate unwanted habits for school, work, fitness, relationships, creative endeavors, and more—indeed for any person or situation where behavioral changes are needed.

      <title>Dr. David Sinclair: The Biology of Slowing &amp; Reversing Aging</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-david-sinclair-the-biology-of-slowing-and-reversing-aging</link>
      <description>In this episode, I am joined by Dr. David Sinclair, tenured Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and an expert researcher in the field of longevity. Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age &amp; Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022. 
In this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology. This episode includes lots of basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.

      <title>Science of Social Bonding in Family, Friendship &amp; Romantic Love</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/science-of-social-bonding-in-family-friendship-and-romantic-love</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss the science of social bonding- the process by which we form attachments. I explain the neural and hormonal basis for "social homeostasis" (our drive for a given amount of socializing) which reveals why we get lonely, why we seek out connection with others and how power dynamics (hierarchies) shape those connections. I also discuss the neurochemical basis of introversion and extroversion, of trust and how shared experiences that promote similar physiological states in two or more individuals, leads to more rapid bonding. I also discuss how food and oxytocin play key roles in social bonding. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed science and practical tools for anyone seeking to find, build or end relationships.

      <title>Dr. David Berson: Understanding Your Brain's Logic &amp; Function</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-david-berson-your-brains-logic-and-function</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Berson, Ph.D., Professor &amp; Chairman of Neuroscience at Brown University. Dr. Berson discovered the neurons in your eye that set your biological rhythms for sleep, wakefulness, mood and appetite. He is also a world-renowned teacher of basic and advanced neuroscience, having taught thousands of university lectures on this topic. Many of his students have become world-leading neuroscientists and teachers themselves. 
Here Dr. Berson takes us on a structured journey into and around the nervous system, explaining: how we perceive the world and our internal landscape, how we balance, see, and remember. Also, how we learn and perform reflexive and deliberate actions, how we visualize and imagine in our mind, and how the various circuits of the brain coordinate all these incredible feats. 
We discuss practical and real-life examples of neural circuit function across the lifespan. Dr. Berson gives us a masterclass in the nervous system—one that, in just less than two hours, will teach you an entire course's worth about the brain and how yours works.

      <title>Erasing Fears &amp; Traumas Based on the Modern Neuroscience of Fear</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/erasing-fears-and-traumas-based-on-the-modern-neuroscience-of-fear</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the "threat reflex" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how "top-down" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.

      <itunes:summary>In this episode, I discuss fear and trauma, including the neural circuits involved in the "threat reflex" and how specific experiences and memories come to activate that system. I also discuss how our body is involved in trauma and fear. First, I describe the logic of fear mechanisms and how "top-down" processing-- meaning connections from the parts of the brain that assign meaning to our feelings, are involved in fear and erasing fears and traumas. Then I discuss what successful fear and trauma treatment must include and consider various treatments for whether they meet that standard, such as EMDR, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Ketamine, other drug-assisted therapies, and more. I also review new data on how 5 minutes per day of deliberate, self-imposed stress can erase fear and depression. And I review the role that social connection plays in erasing or maintaining fears by activating specific molecular pathways in the brain and body. Finally, I review supplementation with over-the-counter compounds for their effects on anxiety and fear and when to take them, if at all.

      <title>Dr. David Buss: How Humans Select &amp; Keep Romantic Partners in Short &amp; Long Term</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-david-buss-how-humans-select-and-keep-romantic-partners-in-short-and-long-term</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. David Buss, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas, Austin, and one of the founding members of the field of evolutionary psychology.
Dr. Buss describes his work on how people select mates for short and long-term relationships, the dynamics of human courtship, and mate value assessment — meaning how people measure up as potential partners. We also discuss the causes of infidelity and differences for infidelity in men and women. He explains how people evaluate and try to alter other people’s mate value as a means to secure and even poach mates. We discuss monogamous and non-monogamous relationships in humans. And we discuss what Dr. Buss calls “the dark triad” — features common in stalkers and narcissists that relate to sexual and psychological violence in relationships.
This episode is sure to be of interest to anyone single or in a relationship who seeks to know how people select mates and anyone who is interested in forming and maintaining healthy romantic partnerships.

      <title>The Science of Gratitude &amp; How to Build a Gratitude Practice</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-gratitude-and-how-to-build-a-gratitude-practice</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the science of gratitude, which has been shown in peer-reviewed studies to have tremendous positive effects on mental and physical health. I explain, however, that most commonly used gratitude practices are ineffective (such as gratitude lists). The key elements of highly effective gratitude practices are described, including the essential need for story (narrative), receiving or perceiving gratitude rather than giving it, and the role that theory of mind plays in this context. I also discuss why we can't simply make up feelings of gratitude and how reluctance undermines the process. I also explain the neural circuit mechanisms that underlie the reductions in fear and increases in motivation and lowering of inflammatory chemicals that effective narrative-based gratitude can trigger. Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol.

Throughout the episode, I use the science of gratitude to design a brief but highly effective protocol. </p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-gratitude-and-how-to-build-a-gratitude-practice">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction: Gratitude Science &amp; Surprises  </p><p>00:01:50 Controlling Heart Rate with Story  </p><p>00:04:48 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>00:09:11 Major, Long-Lasting Benefits of Gratitude Practice  </p><p>00:12:20 Prosocial vs. Defensive Thinking, Behaviors, &amp; Neural Circuits  </p><p>00:17:50 Why We All Need an Effective Gratitude Practice  </p><p>00:21:22 Neurochemistry &amp; Neural Circuits of Gratitude  </p><p>00:25:10 Prefrontal Cortex Set Context  </p><p>00:30:10 Ineffective Gratitude Practices; Autonomic Variables  </p><p>00:34:55 Key Features of Effective Gratitude Practices: Receiving Thanks &amp; Story  </p><p>00:42:30 Theory of Mind Is Key  </p><p>00:45:50 Building Effective Gratitude Practices: Adopting Narratives, Duration  </p><p>00:52:28 Narratives That Shift Brain-Body Circuits  </p><p>00:56:15 You Can’t Lie About Liking Something; Reluctance in Giving  </p><p>00:59:55 How Gratitude Changes Your Brain: Reduces Anxiety, Increases Motivation  </p><p>01:03:00 5 Minutes (Is More Than Enough), 3X Weekly, Timing Each Day  </p><p>01:05:44 Empathy &amp; Anterior Cingulate Cortex  </p><p>01:07:35 Reducing Inflammation &amp; Fear with Gratitude  </p><p>01:10:56 Serotonin, Kanna/Zembrin  </p><p>01:16:00 Neuroplasticity, Pharmacology, Brain Machine Interfaces  </p><p>01:18:50 The Best Gratitude Practices: &amp; How To, My Protocol  </p><p>01:24:25 Subscribe &amp; Feedback, Supporting Sponsors, Supplements  </p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Time Perception &amp; Entrainment by Dopamine, Serotonin &amp; Hormones</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/time-perception-and-entrainment-by-dopamine-serotonin-and-hormones</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how our brain and body track time and the role that neurochemicals, in particular dopamine and serotonin, but also hormones such as melatonin, allow us to orient ourselves in time. I review the three types of time perception: of the past, of the present, and the future, and how dopamine and serotonin adjust both our perception of the speed of the passage of time and our memory of how long previous experiences lasted. I also discuss circannual entrainment, which is the process by which our brain and body are matched to the seasons, and circadian (24 hours) entrainment, both of which subconsciously adjust our perceived measurement of time. I explain the mechanisms of that subconscious control. And I cover the ultradian (90 minutes) rhythms that govern our ability to focus, including how to track when these 90-minute rhythms begin and end for the sake of work and productivity. I include ten tools based on the science of time perception that you can apply to enhance productivity, creativity, and relationships in various contexts.

      <title>Dr. Duncan French: How to Exercise for Strength Gains &amp; Hormone Optimization</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-duncan-french-how-to-exercise-for-strength-gains-and-hormone-optimization</link>
      <description>In this episode, I talk to Dr. Duncan French, Ph.D., the Vice President of Performance at the UFC Performance Institute and a world-class performance specialist. We discuss specific resistance (weight) training regimens for increasing testosterone in men and women and how to vary mechanical loads and rest between sets and workouts to optimize hormone output and training results. We also discuss how stress-induced "catecholamines" can increase testosterone or decrease it, depending on duration and mindset. And we discuss specific cold- and heat- therapies for increasing resilience, reducing inflammation, heat shock proteins and more. We discuss nutrition for training and how to match nutrition to training goals and metabolic flexibility. We discuss mental focus and how long to train for skill development. Finally, we discuss how mixed martial arts and the UFC Performance Institute are a template for exploring human performance more generally. This episode is intended for anyone interested in athletic and mental performance: athletes, students, and recreational exercisers and includes both science and many practical tools people can apply in their own training.

      <title>Using Your Nervous System to Enhance Your Immune System</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/using-your-nervous-system-to-enhance-your-immune-system</link>
      <description>This episode teaches you a lot about the immune system, immune-brain interactions and offers 12 potential tools for enhancing immune system function. I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.
I discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic "washout" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).

      <itunes:summary>This episode teaches you a lot about the immune system, immune-brain interactions and offers 12 potential tools for enhancing immune system function. I discuss how our immune system works and science-supported tools we can use to enhance our immune system.
I discuss the innate and adaptive immune systems and our various microbiomes-- not just in our gut but also in our nose, eyes and mouth and how to keep them healthy. And I review how specific patterns of breathing and foods maintain a healthy mucosal barrier that is crucial for fighting infections. I discuss how certain neurochemicals called catecholamines enhance our immune system function and how to use specific breathing protocols, types and timing of heat and cold exposure, and, if appropriate, supplementation to activate catecholamines. I also discuss the role and use of serotonin for the sake of accessing the specific types of sleep for recovering from illness, and I discuss how to increase glymphatic "washout" of brain debris during sleep. I also review fever, the vagus nerve and the use of atypical yet highly effective compounds for rhinitis (nasal inflammation).

      <title>Dr. Samer Hattar: Timing Your Light, Food, &amp; Exercise for Optimal Sleep, Energy &amp; Mood</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-samer-hattar-timing-light-food-exercise-for-better-sleep-energy-mood</link>
      <description>In this episode, I host Dr. Samer Hattar, Ph.D., Chief of the Section on Light and Circadian Rhythms at the National Institute of Mental Health. Dr. Hattar is a world-renowned expert on how viewing light at particular times adjusts our mood, ability to learn, stress and hormone levels, appetite, and mental health. We discuss how to determine and use your individual light sensitivity to determine the optimal sleep-wake cycle for you. We also discuss how to combine your light viewing and waking time with the timing of your food intake and exercise in order to maximize mental and physical functioning. Dr. Hattar is credited with co-discovering the neurons in the eye that set our circadian clocks and regulate mood and appetite. He explains why even a small shift in daylight savings leads to outsized effects on our biking because of the way that our cells and circadian clocks integrate across many days. And he offers precise tools to rapidly adjust to jet lag, shift work, and reset your clock after a late night of work or socializing. This episode is filled with cutting-edge data on the biological mechanisms of human physiology and practical tools for people of all ages.

      <title>Nutrients for Brain Health &amp; Performance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/nutrients-for-brain-health-and-performance</link>
      <description>This episode I describe science-supported nutrients for brain and performance (cognition) and for nervous system health generally.
I describe 10 tools for this purpose, including specific amounts and sources for Omega-3 fatty acids which make up the "structural fat" of neurons (nerve cells) and allow them to function across our lifespan. I also review data on creatine, phosphatidylserine, anthocyanins, choline, glutamine and how they each impact brain function in healthy people seeking to reinforce and improve their cognition and in those combatting cognitive decline. I describe both food-based and supplement-based sources for these compounds, and their effective dose ranges based on peer-reviewed literature.
Then I review the 3 factors: gut-brain signaling, perceived taste, and learned associations that combine with the metabolic and blood-sugar-elevating effects of food to determine what foods we seek and prefer. Amazingly, it's not just about what tastes good to us. Next, I explore how we can leverage the neural circuits of learned food preference toward seeking and enjoying the right foods for brain health and performance. I also review new data on non-caloric sweeteners and why consuming them with glucose-elevating foods can be detrimental, in some cases rapidly leading to insulin dysregulation. This episode covers more than 10 actionable tools for those seeking to improve and/or maintain brain function, and it explains modern neuroscience underlying of our sense of taste, our food seeking preferences and brain metabolism.

      <title>Effects of Fasting &amp; Time Restricted Eating on Fat Loss &amp; Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/effects-of-fasting-and-time-restricted-eating-on-fat-loss-and-health</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss the science and practice of fasting also called time-restricted feeding. I review the data on how limiting food intake to specific portions of every 24-hour cycle (or fasting longer) impacts weight loss, fat loss specifically, liver health, mental focus, muscle, longevity and more. I explain how "fasted" is contextual, and relates to blood glucose levels and their downstream effects, and how the depth of fasting can be adjusted with behaviors such as different types of exercise, or with glucose disposal agents. I also discuss the optimal fasting protocol: and both the absolute (non-negotiable) and variable (contextual) features of a fasting/time-restricted-feeding protocol that will allow you to get the most benefits. I also discuss what does and does not break a fast, the effects of fasting on hormones like testosterone and cortisol and on fertility. I also review how different feeding windows of 8 or 10 or 4 hours differentially impact the effects of fasting, and why the classic 8 hour feeding window came to be but also might be ideal. I discuss mechanisms and offer tools to discern the optimal fasting duration and timing for you.

      <title>Dr. Craig Heller: Using Temperature To Optimize Performance, Brain &amp; Body Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-craig-heller-using-temperature-for-performance-brain-and-body-health</link>
      <description>This episode I am joined by Dr. Craig Heller, Ph.D., Professor of Biology at Stanford University and world expert on the science of temperature regulation. We discuss how the body and brain maintain temperature under different conditions and how most everyone uses the wrong approach to cool off or heat up. Dr. Heller teaches us the best ways and in doing so, explains how to offset hyperthermia and hypothermia. He also explains how we can use the precise timing and location of cooling on our body to greatly enhance endurance and weight training performance. He describes how cooling technology discovered and engineered in his laboratory has led to a tripling of anaerobic (weight training) performance and allowed endurance athletes to run further and faster, as well as to eliminate delayed onset muscle soreness. Dr. Heller explains how heat impairs muscular and mental performance, and how to cool the brain to reduce inflammation and to enhance sleep and cognition. We discuss how anyone can apply these principles for themselves, even their dogs! Our conversation includes both many practical tools and mechanistic science.

      <title>Controlling Your Dopamine For Motivation, Focus &amp; Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction</link>
      <description>This episode serves as a sort of “Dopamine Masterclass”. I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine.

      <title>Dr. Matthew Johnson: Psychedelics for Treating Mental Disorders</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-matthew-johnson-psychedelic-medicine</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss medical research on psychedelic compounds with Dr. Matthew Johnson, Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. We discuss the biology and medical clinical-trial uses of psilocybin, MDMA, ayahuasca, DMT, and LSD. Dr. Johnson teaches us what the clinical trials in his lab are revealing about the potential these compounds hold for the treatment of depression, addiction, trauma, eating disorders, ADHD, and other disorders of the mind. Dr. Johnson describes a typical psychedelic experiment in his laboratory, start to finish, including the conditions for optimal clinical outcomes. And he explains some of the potential hazards and common misconceptions and pitfalls related to psychedelic medicine. Dr. Johnson explains flashbacks, the heightened risks of certain people and age groups using psychedelics and the ever evolving legal and pharmaceutical industry landscape surrounding psychedelics. Dr. Johnson also explains how the scientific study of psychedelics is likely to set the trajectory of psychiatric medicine in the years to come. Dr. Johnson is among a small handful of researchers who have pioneered the clinical study of these powerful compounds. He has unprecedented insight into how they can be woven into other psychiatric treatments, changing ones sense of self and of reality.

      <title>ADHD &amp; How Anyone Can Improve Their Focus</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/adhd-and-how-anyone-can-improve-their-focus</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder): what it is, the common myths, and the biology and psychology of ADHD.
I discuss both behavioral and pharmacologic treatments for ADHD, and brain-machine interface tools. I also discuss behavioral training protocols that can improve focus in people with ADHD and those without ADHD, and for people of different ages. I discuss the role of dopamine in coordinating 'default-mode' and 'task-related' neural networks, attentional "blinks" (lapses of attention) and how to overcome them, and the role of actual blinks in time perception and attention. Finally, I review some of the prescription and over-the-counter compounds for increasing focus such as Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil and Armodafinil, the racetams, Alpha-GPC and phosphatidylserine and the role of diet for managing ADHD (and the controversies of diet for ADHD).
The role of cell phones/technology in ADHD and ADHD-like challenges with focus are also discussed. Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.

Throughout, both basic science and clinical scenarios, as well as applicable tools and resources are covered.</p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/adhd-and-how-anyone-can-improve-their-focus">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction &amp; Note About Diagnosis  </p><p>00:03:44 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>00:07:56 ADHD vs. ADD: Genetics, IQ, Rates in Kids &amp; Adults  </p><p>00:13:00 Attention &amp; Focus, Impulse Control  </p><p>00:14:57 Hyper-focus  </p><p>00:16:45 Time Perception  </p><p>00:18:25 The Pile System  </p><p>00:20:00 Working Memory  </p><p>00:24:10 Hyper-Focus &amp; Dopamine  </p><p>00:26:40 Neural Circuits In ADHD: Default Mode Network &amp; Task-Related Networks  </p><p>00:32:57 Low Dopamine in ADHD &amp; Stimulant Use &amp; Abuse  </p><p>00:37:10 Sugar, Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil  </p><p>00:47:00 Non-Prescribed Adderall, Caffeine, Nicotine  </p><p>00:49:18 How Stimulants “Teach” the Brains of ADHD Children to Focus  </p><p>00:52:00 When To Medicate: A Highly Informed (Anecdotal) Case Study  </p><p>00:56:35 Elimination Diets &amp; Allergies In ADHD  </p><p>01:04:46 Omega-3 Fatty Acids: EPAs &amp; DHAs  </p><p>01:07:00 Modulation vs Mediation of Biological Processes  </p><p>01:10:50 Attentional Blinks  </p><p>01:16:56 Open Monitoring &amp; 17-Minute Focus Enhancement  </p><p>01:22:50 Blinking, Dopamine &amp; Time Perception; &amp; Focus Training  </p><p>01:30:10 Reverberatory Neural &amp; Physical Activity  </p><p>01:33:40 Adderall, Ritalin &amp; Blink Frequency  </p><p>01:35:00 Cannabis  </p><p>01:37:30 Interoceptive Awareness  </p><p>01:41:15 Ritalin, Adderall, Modafinil, Armodafinil; Smart Drugs &amp; Caffeine: Dangers  </p><p>01:48:05 DHA Fatty Acids, Phosphatidylserine  </p><p>01:50:54 Ginko Biloba  </p><p>01:51:45 Modafinil &amp; Armodafinil: Dopamine Action &amp; Orexin  </p><p>01:56:19 Acetylcholine: Circuits Underlying Focus; Alpha-GPC  </p><p>01:59:04 L-Tyrosine, (PEA) Phenylethylamine  </p><p>02:01:23 Racetams, Noopept  </p><p>02:05:15 Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Combining Technology &amp; Pharmacology  </p><p>02:09:14 Smart Phones &amp; ADHD &amp; Sub-Clinical Focus Issues In Adults &amp; Kids  </p><p>02:14:30 Synthesis/Summary  </p><p>02:16:10 Support for Podcast &amp; Research, Supplement Resources  </p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Dislcosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Healthy Eating &amp; Eating Disorders - Anorexia, Bulimia, Binging</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/healthy-eating-and-eating-disorders-anorexia-bulimia-binging</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss what drives hunger and satiety, and the role our brain, stomach, fat and hormones play in regulating hunger and turning off the desire to eat more. I also address how protein is assimilated better early in the day than it is later in the day, and why those using intermittent fasting might want to shift their feeding window to earlier in the day.
Then I delve into the topic of disorders of eating: Anorexia Nervosa, where people starve themselves and Bulimia Nervosa where people binge and purge their food. I discuss some common myths about Anorexia such as the role of media images increasing the rates of anorexia and the myth of the "perfectionist" anorexic. I also review the symptoms, and the brain and chemical systems disrupted in this condition. I explain how anorexics become hyperaware of the fat content of foods and develop reflexive habits of fat-hyperawareness. Then I discuss the most effective treatments ranging from family-based models to those that target the habitual nature of low-fat/calorie food choices. I also discuss new more experimental clinical trials on MDMA, Psilocybin and Ibogaine for Anorexia, and both their promise and risks
I review the latest work on binge eating disorder and brain stimulation, drug treatments and thyroid disruption in Bulimia and why the treatments for Bulimia are so similar to those for ADHD. Finally, I discuss "cheat days," body dysmorphia and the growing list of novel forms of eating disorders start to finish. As always, science and science-based tools are discussed.

      <title>Dr. Robert Sapolsky: Science of Stress, Testosterone &amp; Free Will</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will</link>
      <description>In this episode, I interview Dr. Robert Sapolsky, Ph.D., Professor of Biology, Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery at Stanford University. We discuss stress, what defines short-term versus long-term stress, and how stress can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. We also discuss stress mitigation and how our sense of control over stress mitigation techniques, including exercise, determine health outcomes. Dr. Sapolsky explains some of the key effects of the hormone testosterone — how it can amplify pre-existing tendencies for aggression or sexual behavior, but that it does not produce those behaviors per se. He also explains how testosterone impacts our social hierarchies, sense of confidence, and willingness to embrace challenges of different kinds. He also explains how our behaviors and perceptions shape testosterone levels. And we discuss estrogen and the powerful role it plays in brain development, health and longevity. Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society.

Finally, we discuss free will, what it means to have free will, and if we have any free will, including how knowledge alone might allow us to make better decisions for ourselves and society. </p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-robert-sapolsky-science-of-stress-testosterone-and-free-will">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction: Dr. Robert Sapolsky  </p><p>00:02:25 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>00:06:30 Stress: Short &amp; Long-Term, Good &amp; Bad  </p><p>00:09:11 Valence &amp; Amygdala  </p><p>00:11:00 Testosterone: Common Myths vs. Actual Truths  </p><p>00:15:15 Behaviors that Affect Testosterone  </p><p>00:17:20 Mindsets &amp; Contexts that Affect Testosterone  </p><p>00:20:28 How Finger Length Ratios Reflect Prenatal Hormone Levels  </p><p>00:22:30 Aggression: Male-Female, Female-Male, &amp; Female-Female  </p><p>00:24:05 Testosterone: The Challenge Hypothesis  </p><p>00:29:20 How Dopamine Impacts Testosterone &amp; Motivation  </p><p>00:32:32 Estrogen: Improves Brain &amp; Longevity BUT TIMING IS KEY  </p><p>00:39:40 Are Testosterone &amp; Sperm Counts in Males Really Dropping?  </p><p>00:42:15 Stress Mitigation &amp; Our Sense of Control  </p><p>00:51:35 How Best to Buffer Stress  </p><p>00:57:04 Power of Perception, Choice &amp; Individual Differences  </p><p>01:00:32 Context-Setting, Prefrontal Cortex &amp; Hierarchy  </p><p>01:11:20 How Dr. Sapolsky Accomplishes Deep Thinking  </p><p>01:13:17 Do We Have Free Will?  </p><p>01:20:50 How to Apply Knowledge &amp; Learning  </p><p>01:23:44 Robert’s New Book: “Determined: The Science of Life Without Free Will”  </p><p>01:28:27 Reflections, Support of Podcast, &amp; Supporting Stress Research  </p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Understanding &amp; Conquering Depression</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/understanding-and-conquering-depression</link>
      <description>This episode, I explain what major depression is at the biological and psychological level and the various treatments that peer-reviewed studies have revealed can help prevent and treat depression. I explain the three major chemical systems that are altered in depression: norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. I discuss genetic predispositions to depression and how stress, thyroid hormone and cortisol play a role in many forms of depression. I also discuss inflammation as a common feature of many depression symptoms. I review 8 specific science-supported protocols for treating and avoiding depression, including EPA fatty acids (which have been shown to rival certain prescription treatments), how exercise protects against depression, studies of creatine, adjusting dopamine balance and more. I also discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials for ketamine and psilocybin for depression, how these compounds work and finally, I review how ketogenic diets can help in certain cases of depression, especially treatment-resistant major depression.

      <title>Dr. Anna Lembke: Understanding &amp; Treating Addiction</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-anna-lembke-understanding-and-treating-addiction</link>
      <description>This episode I interview Dr. Anna Lembke, M.D., Chief of the Stanford Addiction Medicine Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Dr. Lembke is a psychiatrist expert in treating addictions of all kinds: drugs, alcohol, food, sex, video games, gambling, food, medication, etc. Dr. Lembke is also an expert in the opioid crisis, and the author of Dopamine Nation.
We discuss the biology and psychology of why people become addicted to certain substances and behaviors and the key role that our "dopamine balance" plays in creating addiction. We also discuss the science and practice of how to conquer addictions, why people relapse and how to avoid relapsing. Dr. Lembke also shares her expertise on topics closely related to addiction such as community, shame and lying and she explains why telling the truth—even about the most basic things in daily life, adjusts dopamine levels in our brain.
This episode is an important one for anyone struggling with addictions of any kind, for their friends and families and for health care professionals. It is also for anyone who has defeated addiction and is determined to stay clean. Last but not least, it helps explain why all humans do what we do, and how we can all maintain a healthy sense of pleasure seeking in life.

      <title>How to Control Your Sense of Pain &amp; Pleasure</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-control-your-sense-of-pain-and-pleasure</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss our sense of pain and pleasure: where and how they each arise in our mind and body and various ways to control their intensity. I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain "syndromes" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. I discuss neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.
Note: The description of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was intentionally simplified and does not include mention of dorsal horn spinal relay neurons, etc. For an excellent full text review of this anatomy and circuits for touch sensing, please see: https://bit.ly/3jH9CPf

      <itunes:summary>This episode I discuss our sense of pain and pleasure: where and how they each arise in our mind and body and various ways to control their intensity. I discuss the science of behavioral tools like acupuncture and hypnosis and directed pressure, including the neural circuits they each activate to modulate our experience of pain or pleasure. I also discuss whole body pain, pain "syndromes" and novel pain relief compounds such as Acetyl-L-Carnitine, SAMe and Agmatine. I discuss neuroplasticity of the pain system and the key role that visual perception plays in pain modulation. Finally, I address the link between dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin, with arousal, pleasure and pain. As always, both basic science and various protocols are described.
Note: The description of the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) was intentionally simplified and does not include mention of dorsal horn spinal relay neurons, etc. For an excellent full text review of this anatomy and circuits for touch sensing, please see: https://bit.ly/3jH9CPf

      <title>Dr. Matt Walker: The Science &amp; Practice of Perfecting Your Sleep</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-matthew-walker-the-science-and-practice-of-perfecting-your-sleep</link>
      <description>In this episode, my guest is Dr. Matt Walker, Ph.D., Professor of Neuroscience and Psychology and the Founder &amp; Director of the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is also the author of the international best-selling book Why We Sleep and the host of "The Matt Walker Podcast." We discuss the biology of sleep, including its various stages and what specifically happens to those stages when we don't get enough sleep. We also discuss the effects of sunlight, caffeine, alcohol, naps, hormones, exercise, marijuana, sexual activity, and various supplements on sleep. The episode consists of both basic science information and many science-supported actionable tools.

      <title>How to Optimize Your Brain-Body Function &amp; Health</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-optimize-your-brain-body-function-and-health</link>
      <description>This episode I describe how the organs of the body influence the function and health of our brain and how our brain controls our bodily organs. The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode I describe how the organs of the body influence the function and health of our brain and how our brain controls our bodily organs. The conscious awareness of this brain-body dialogue is called interoception. I describe how two factors- mechanical forces (e.g., pressure, pain, volume, etc.) and chemical factors (e.g., gut acidity, microbiome diversity, etc.) combine to influence our moods, control inflammation, immune system, recovery from injury and more. I explain how specific actions of our lungs, heart, spleen, and diaphragm, control our brain via the vagus nerve and other neural pathways. I describe 11 science-supported protocols for enhancing brain-body health and the logic behind them.</p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-optimize-your-brain-body-function-and-health">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Your Sense of Self: Interoception  </p><p>00:01:25 Protocol 1: Fermented Foods, Not Fiber, to Reduce Inflammation  </p><p>00:03:45 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up</p><p>00:08:22 Main Drivers of Feelings &amp; Performance  </p><p>00:11:45 Brain-Body: A Mechanical &amp; Chemical Dialogue  </p><p>00:17:50 LDB (Lung-Diaphragm-Brain) Dialogue  </p><p>00:21:00 Protocols 2, 3, 4: Control Heart Rate With Breathing  </p><p>00:29:08 Sensing Lung Pressure: Piezo Receptors  </p><p>00:30:54 Carbon Dioxide, From Air to Blood  </p><p>00:34:02 Protocol 5: Alert While Calm  </p><p>00:40:50 Baroreceptors: Hering-Breuer Reflex  </p><p>00:42:47 Gut Volume &amp; The Desire to Open Your Mouth  </p><p>00:48:18 Protocol 6: Enhancing Gut-To-Brain Communication, Fasting  </p><p>00:51:50 Intestines, Fatty Acids, Amino Acids &amp; Sugar  </p><p>00:57:00 Protocol 7: Reducing Sugar Cravings with Specific Amino Acid Nutrients  </p><p>00:58:58 Gut Acidity (Is Good)  </p><p>01:02:20 Improving Nasal Microbiome  </p><p>01:04:13 Inflammation &amp; Microbiome: Fiber vs. Fermented  </p><p>01:11:15 Protocol 8: Reducing Inflammation &amp; Enhancing Brain Function w/Fermented Foods  </p><p>01:13:10 Leaking Guts, Auto-Immune Function &amp; Glutamine  </p><p>01:15:50 Gut Acidity: HCl (hydrochloric acid), Pepsin  </p><p>01:18:30 Probiotics &amp; Brain Fog  </p><p>01:21:45 Nausea: Happens in Your Brain; Area Postrema  </p><p>01:28:25 Protocol 9: Reducing Nausea: Ginger, Peppermint, CBD, etc.  </p><p>01:30:40 Fever: Triggers and Control Knobs: OVLT  </p><p>01:37:00 Protocol 10: Cooling the Blood Properly  </p><p>01:38:53 Sensing Feelings, Vagus Nerve, Stress  </p><p>01:41:50 Mental Emotions Reflect Bodily Conditions  </p><p>01:45:00 Sensing Other People’s Emotions via the Body  </p><p>01:46:00 Protocol 11: Increasing Interoception, Sensing Heartbeat  </p><p>01:50:40 Conclusions &amp; Resources  </p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Maximizing Productivity, Physical &amp; Mental Health with Daily Tools</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/maximizing-productivity-physical-and-mental-health-with-daily-tools</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss science-supported tools for enhancing focus, learning, creativity, sleep, physical strength and endurance and brain and body health. I explain each protocol in detail, the rationale behind it, and how the protocol can be adjusted depending on individual needs. I set these tools in the context of a 24-hour day as a way of framing how one might incorporate these tools and protocols into their own daily routine.

      <title>The Science of Hearing, Balance &amp; Accelerated Learning</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-hearing-balance-and-accelerated-learning</link>
      <description>This episode I describe how our ears and nervous system decode sound waves and gravity to allow us to hear and make sense of sounds. I also describe protocols for rapid learning of sound and other types of information. I discuss sound localization, doppler effects (sound motion), pitch perception and how we isolate sounds in noisy environments. I also review the scientific findings on binaural beats and white noise and how they can improve learning. Other topics and protocols include tinnitus, sea sickness, ear movement, ear growth and the science-supported ways we can all accelerate learning using "gap effects".

      <itunes:summary>This episode I describe how our ears and nervous system decode sound waves and gravity to allow us to hear and make sense of sounds. I also describe protocols for rapid learning of sound and other types of information. I discuss sound localization, doppler effects (sound motion), pitch perception and how we isolate sounds in noisy environments. I also review the scientific findings on binaural beats and white noise and how they can improve learning. Other topics and protocols include tinnitus, sea sickness, ear movement, ear growth and the science-supported ways we can all accelerate learning using "gap effects".

      <title>Dr. Karl Deisseroth: Understanding &amp; Healing the Mind</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/karl-deisseroth-understanding-and-healing-the-mind</link>
      <description>Dr. Karl Deisseroth, MD, PhD, is a clinical psychiatrist and scientist who directs a bioengineering research laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine. His work aims to understand and develop treatments for disorders of the mind such as depression, attention deficit disorders (ADHD &amp; ADD), autism, schizophrenia, anxiety, eating disorders, borderline personality and obsessive-compulsive disorder. We discuss his experience treating his patients and his laboratory’s mission to find and develop cures for mental disease and tools for probing how the brain works.

      <title>How Smell, Taste &amp; Pheromone-Like Chemicals Control You</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-smell-taste-and-pheromone-like-chemicals-control-you</link>
      <description>This episode explains how we sense chemicals through smell, taste, and pheromones. How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and on the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do, and our hormones. I explain the 3 types of responses to smell, the 5 types of tastes, the possible existence of sixth taste sense, and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. I explain how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. I discuss how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods, including how to make sour things taste sweet and develop a heightened sense of smell and taste.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode explains how we sense chemicals through smell, taste, and pheromones. How things smell and taste and chemicals in the tears, breath, and on the skin of others have a profound effect on how we feel, what we do, and our hormones. I explain the 3 types of responses to smell, the 5 types of tastes, the possible existence of sixth taste sense, and how the act of sniffing can make us learn and focus better. I explain how smell and taste reflect brain health and can assess and even promote brain regeneration. I discuss how eating specific categories of foods makes us crave more of those foods, including how to make sour things taste sweet and develop a heightened sense of smell and taste. </p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-smell-taste-and-pheromone-like-chemicals-control-you">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://wakingup.com/huberman">https://wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><p>Momentous: <a href="https://livemomentous.com/huberman">https://livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction</p><p>00:06:02 Sensing Chemicals: Smell, Taste &amp; Chemicals That People Make To Control Each Other</p><p>00:09:10 Vision Protocols Recap (Brief) &amp; Correction</p><p>00:12:20 Color Vision: Excellent Resource: What is Color?

      <title>The Science of Vision, Eye Health &amp; Seeing Better</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-vision-eye-health-and-seeing-better</link>
      <description>This episode I describe how we see, meaning how our eyes focus, convert light information into electricity the rest of the brain can understand and how our brain creates the incredible thing we experience as “sight”. I also describe how we can train and support our visual system to improve at any age. I describe more than a dozen protocols to support depth perception, offset near-sightedness, improve mood, sleep, and our ability to focus (both visual focus and our mental focus generally). I also explain how to use eyesight to improve our levels of alertness and why visual hallucinations, lazy eyes and colorblindness occur. I also describe various compounds that may assist in supporting visual health and possibly improve our vision. Many simple, zero-cost protocols and a lot of scientific mechanisms are covered in this episode in clear language anyone can understand-- it is for anyone that values their brain and whether eyesight, young, adult-age or advanced age.

      <title>How to Build Endurance in Your Brain &amp; Body</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-build-endurance-in-your-brain-and-body</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss endurance: our ability to perform effort over extended amounts of time. I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the "extra gear" we all can leverage for effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us to access untapped energetic resources.

        <![CDATA[<p>This <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-build-endurance-in-your-brain-and-body">episode</a> I discuss endurance: our ability to perform effort over extended amounts of time. I describe the four kinds of endurance: muscular endurance, long duration (single-set) efforts, and the two kinds of high intensity interval training (HIIT). I discuss efficiency of effort and maximizing quality of effort, and a hydration formula. I review how our heart literally gets stronger when we oxygenate muscles properly. I also discuss motivation for long bouts of work and the visual physiological basis of the "extra gear" we all can leverage for effort. Finally, I review how accelerating as we fatigue can allow us to access untapped energetic resources.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors:</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/ag1BC">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/wakingupBC">https://www.wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction</p><p>00:05:45 Why Everyone Should Train Endurance</p><p>00:09:49 All Episodes Now Searchable at hubermanlab.com &amp; The Neural Network</p><p>00:11:28 How To Maintain Muscle</p><p>00:12:56 Endurance: It’s Not What You Think, Crossover With Brain Function</p><p>00:14:38 Energy; Many Paths To ATP: Creatine, Glucose, Glycogen, Fat; Ketones</p><p>00:18:00 The Vital Need For Oxygen: But Why?</p><p>00:19:00 What Allows Us To Endure (Anything)?</p><p>00:20:46 The 5 Things That Allow Us To Persist/Endure &amp; What Causes Quitting</p><p>00:22:50 Why You Quit: It IS All In Your Mind</p><p>00:27:19 The “90% Mental” Myth</p><p>00:28:10 The Critical Need For Carbohydrates &amp; Electrolytes (&amp; Sometimes Ketones)</p><p>00:30:10 Phospho-Creatine, Glycogen, pH, Temperature Is Key</p><p>00:31:36 Using Your Blood, Heart, &amp; Lungs To Go Longer, Further, With More Intensity</p><p>00:35:40 An Excellent Review on the Science of Training Adaptations (See Caption On YouTube)</p><p>00:37:15 The 4 Kinds of Endurance</p><p>00:38:53 Muscular Endurance: Powerful for Everyone: Posture, Performance, Resilience</p><p>00:41:50 Protocol For Building Muscular Endurance.

      <title>Science of Muscle Growth, Increasing Strength &amp; Muscular Recovery</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/science-of-muscle-growth-increasing-strength-and-muscular-recovery?utm_campaign=Science+%26+Tools+for+Muscle+Growth%2C+Increasing+Strength+%26+Muscular+Recovery&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe how our brain and nervous system control muscle tissue and how to leverage that for muscle maintenance, growth (hypertrophy) and recovery. I explain how neurons control muscle contractions and limb movements. I explain muscle metabolism and muscle fiber recruitment. I detail protocols for increasing muscular growth and for neuro-muscular recovery. I explain the effects of deliberate cold, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-histamines on training progress. I describe science-supported protocols using certain weight load ranges, total sets per week, training intensity, frequency, and in-between set activities if one's goal is to increase muscle growth, strength or endurance. I review three foundational compounds and nutrients and three optimization compounds and nutrients that have been shown to improve neuro-muscular performance. Finally, I explain how to leverage exercise and weight training to enhance cognitive function.

      <description>This episode I describe the science of fat loss, including how fat is mobilized and oxidized (burned) and how to increase fat burning by leveraging the nervous system. Most people don't realize it, but our neurons connect to our fat and release epinephrine/adrenaline to facilitate fat oxidation.

      <title>How to Learn Skills Faster</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-learn-skills-faster?utm_campaign=How+to+Learn+Skills+Faster&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss the science and practice of learning physical skills: what it involves at a biological level, and what to focus on during skill learning at each stage to maximize learning speed and depth. I also describe what to do immediately after a training session (note: this is different than the optimal protocol for cognitive skill training) and as you progress to more advanced levels of performance. I also cover the science of skill-based visualization which does have benefits, but only if done correctly and at the correct times. I discuss auto-replay of skill learning in the brain during sleep and the value of adding in post-training ‘deliberately idle’ sessions. I cover how to immediately improve limb-range-of-motion by leveraging cerebellum function, error generation, optimal repetition numbers for learning and more. As always, scientific mechanism, peer-reviewed studies and science-based protocols are discussed.

      <title>Supercharge Exercise Performance &amp; Recovery with Cooling</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/supercharge-exercise-performance-and-recovery-with-cooling/</link>
      <description>This episode I explain the science of heating and cooling the body, a process called thermoregulation-- and how to apply that knowledge to significantly improve physical performance. I describe the three areas of our body that can remove heat (or bring heat into the body) faster than anywhere else, why that is so, and how proper cooling of these areas with specific protocols can allow people to perform 200-600% more volume and repetitions of resistance exercises at the same weight loads, or to run, cycle or swim significantly further. I also describe how to use directed cooling of so-called glabrous skin: the bottoms of feet, palms and face, to significantly enhance recovery times from exercise. Also, why the common practices of trying to heat up or cool the body via the torso or whole-body submersion in cold can be inefficient and/or dangerous-- and the better alternatives. Finally, I discuss the temperature-effects of caffeine, alcohol and anti-inflammatory compounds. The information in this episode is focused on mechanisms and tools for increasing athletic or exercise performance.

The information in this episode is focused on mechanisms and tools for increasing athletic or exercise performance.</p><p>For the full show notes, visit <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/supercharge-exercise-performance-and-recovery-with-cooling/">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><h2>Supplements from Momentous</h2><p><a href="https://www.livemomentous.com/pages/huberman?irclickid=y34ypYQ0vxyIWDCTfRQmEXIuUkD1Ob10U0Gk180&amp;irgwc=1&amp;nb_platform=impact&amp;nb_adid=1318412&amp;nb_cid=15826&amp;nb_pid=3406974&amp;nb_aname=Podcast+Link&amp;nb_atype=TEXT_LINK&amp;nb_asize=&amp;nb_product_sku=&amp;nb_partner_name=Huberman+Lab&amp;nb_mtype=mediapartner&amp;nb_partner_shared_id=&amp;utm_source=Huberman+Lab&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=3406974&amp;utm_campaign=15826&amp;_ga=undefined">https://www.livemomentous.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction</p><p>(00:00:31) Sponsors: AG1, LMNT</p><p>(00:05:08) Physical Performance &amp; Skill Learning</p><p>(00:06:40) Optimal Learning Protocol (Recap): 4 Steps</p><p>(00:08:31) Variables Impacting Physical Performance</p><p>(00:10:00) Temperature Is the Dominant Variable</p><p>(00:12:08) Understanding Mechanism Is Key</p><p>(00:13:42) Heat: The Enemy of All Performance (&amp; Why)</p><p>(00:16:30) Blood Flow &amp; Sweating &amp; Piloerection</p><p>(00:22:35) Heat Is What Limits Effort: Even If You Feel Fine/Motivated</p><p>(00:25:29) Proper Cooling Can Double, Triple, Quadruple (Or More) Your Ability</p><p>(00:26:42) Heat Induced Confusion &amp; Death</p><p>(00:30:02) The Three Body Parts Best For Heating &amp; Cooling Your Whole Body</p><p>(00:31:38) Face, Palms, Bottoms of Feet; Glabrous Skin</p><p>(00:33:00) Arterio-Venous Anastamoses (AVAs) Are Super Cool(ing)!</p><p>(00:37:15) Palmar Cooling Can Supercharge Your Athletic Performance</p><p>(00:38:35) ATP, Pyruvate Kinase &amp; Heat</p><p>(00:40:55) Palmer Cooling Outperforms Anabolic Steroids Several-Fold</p><p>(00:43:45) Increasing Endurance, Willpower &amp; Persistence</p><p>(00:46:33) Cardiac Drift, &amp; Moving the ”I Quit” Point</p><p>(00:50:44) Deliberate Heating: Myths and Better Protocols</p><p>(00:53:20) Protocols For Self-Directed Cooling To Vastly Improve Performance</p><p>(00:59:23) How To Use Cold To Recover Faster &amp; More Thoroughly</p><p>(01:02:05) Ice Baths &amp; Cold Showers Can Prevent Training Progress: mTOR, etc.</p><p>(01:06:29) Alcohol, Caffeine, NSAIDs: Their Temperature Effects Matter</p><p>(01:09:44) Are Stimulants Counter Productive For Performance?

      <title>Boost Your Energy &amp; Immune System with Cortisol &amp; Adrenaline </title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/using-cortisol-and-adrenaline-to-boost-our-energy-and-immune-system?utm_campaign=Boost+Your+Energy+%26+Immune+System+with+Cortisol+%26+Adrenaline&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>This episode I describe the biology of two essential hormones we all make: cortisol and adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Cortisol and adrenaline powerfully regulate our levels of energy, focus and immune system function. I describe various science-supported tools and practices to increase or decrease cortisol and/or adrenaline, depending on one's specific needs and goals. I also describe the biology of nootropics, and how cortisol and adrenaline can improve or degrade learning. Finally, I review the scientific data and tools for timing the release of these hormones to improve memory, energy and immune system function.

      <title>How to Control Your Metabolism by Thyroid &amp; Growth Hormone </title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-control-your-metabolism-by-thyroid-and-growth-hormone/</link>
      <description>This episode discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanisms and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed.

        <![CDATA[<p>This episode discusses metabolism and how our thyroid hormone and growth hormone control our metabolism. I also clarify that metabolism isn't just about burning energy, it’s about converting energy from different sources into fuels for building and repairing our tissues such as muscle, brain, and tendons and mobilizing energy from body fat storage. I discuss the role of iodine, selenium, and salt for thyroid health, and how specific exercise protocols, amino acids and temperature can dramatically shift levels of growth hormone release in waking and in sleep. I also describe the current landscape of prescription compounds, peptides and other factors for changing levels of thyroid and growth hormone, and some of their risks. Throughout the episode, mechanisms and tools grounded in specific mechanisms are discussed.</p><h2>Supplements from Thorne</h2><p><a href="https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">https://www.thorne.com/u/huberma</a><a href="http://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">n</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>(00:00:00) Introduction</p><p>(00:06:05) Thyroid &amp; Growth Hormone</p><p>(00:08:44) Food Shapes: Do They Matter?</p><p>(00:11:43) Stevia: Naming &amp; Impact</p><p>(00:13:30) Metabolism 101: Your Brain the Furnace</p><p>(00:17:33) Releasing Hormones From Your Brain, Stimulating Hormones from Your Pituitary</p><p>(00:21:04) Thyroid Hormone’s Real Effects: Growth, Repair and Energy Consumption of Tissues</p><p>(00:22:45) Iodine, L-Tyrosine &amp; Selenium: The Trio Essential For Thyroid Function</p><p>(00:26:05) How Much Iodine Do We Need?

      <title>How Hormones Control Hunger, Eating &amp; Satiety</title>
      <link>https://hubermanlab.com/how-our-hormones-control-our-hunger-eating-and-satiety/</link>
      <description>This episode I discuss how hormones from our gut, liver, pancreas and brain control our appetite--and the specific tools we can use to adjust those hormones in order to achieve specific goals. I explain the brain areas that control our desire to eat, and our desire to stop eating. I discuss a hormone we all can make that is regulated by UV-rays from sunlight that reduces our appetite. I also explain that when we eat controls our appetite and not the other way around (and how to leverage that fact). I describe how we are basically always eating until we reach a threshold level of fatty acids and amino acids in our gut and the factors that can alter that signaling and make us eat far more than we need. I also explain how insulin, glucose and glucagon work, why cholesterol is so key for ovary, adrenal, liver and testes function and how the ketogenic diet impacts glucose and thyroid levels. As always, I describe many tools: specific supplements, prescription compounds, specific types (and timing) of exercise to regulate hormones, specific timing and types of eating, ways to reduce sugar cravings by triggering release of the hormone CCK, and more.
Note: A future episode will cover Thyroid hormone. Also, I mis-spoke when explaining POMC neurons. I said “P-M-O-C” but should have said “POMC”. Apologies. The name I gave for what POMC is, however, was correct: "proopiomelanocortin".

      <title>How to Optimize Testosterone &amp; Estrogen</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen?utm_campaign=How+to+Optimize+Testosterone+%26+Estrogen&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss testosterone and estrogen hormones and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: "what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. We discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels by changing their binding to other proteins, raising them directly, or changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I discuss testosterone and estrogen <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/topics/hormone-health">hormones</a> and how they impact the brain, body, and behavior after puberty. I also discuss how various behaviors such as exercise (resistance and endurance training) and sex or observing sex impact these hormones and their levels. I ask: "what specifically is it about such activities that impact testosterone and estrogen?"; the resounding theme is that when our nervous system is activated in particular ways, it drives our endocrine system and vascular system to activate or repress certain hormone networks in predictable ways. I also discuss peer-reviewed studies and protocols addressing (at a mechanistic level) how light, cold and heat, and respiration (breathing) can positively or negatively impact testosterone and estrogen. We discuss specific supplements and compounds that peer-reviewed studies illustrate can adjust testosterone and estrogen levels by changing their binding to other proteins, raising them directly, or changing other hormones released from the brain and pituitary. I discuss optimization in the normal reference ranges for these hormones, and I discuss pheromones, apnea, menstrual cycles, menopause and andropause.</p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-how-to-optimize-testosterone-and-estrogen?utm_campaign=How+to+Optimize+Testosterone+%26+Estrogen&amp;utm_source=podcast+player+show+notes&amp;utm_medium=text+link">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/ag1BC">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/wakingupBC">https://www.wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction  </p><p>00:00:26 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up  </p><p>00:05:50 Hormone Optimization  </p><p>00:07:00 Salutogenesis: A Powerful Way to Conceptualize Health  </p><p>00:10:03 Estrogen and Testosterone: Sources, Levels and Ratios  </p><p>00:15:46 The Power of Competition, Plus: Anxiety, Persistence and Dopamine  </p><p>00:20:58 Testosterone and Libido Pre-Ovulation  </p><p>00:21:48 Estrogen and Sexual Receptivity; Libido In Males  </p><p>00:23:10 How Sex Behavior Impacts Testosterone: Observing vs. Actual vs. Abstinence  </p><p>00:26:46 Testosterone and Prolactin: Sex Seeking vs. Pair Bonding  </p><p>00:27:30 DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone): Effects on Levels/Ratios  </p><p>00:28:45 Behaviors That Decrease Testosterone (and Cortisol): Parenting and Prolactin  </p><p>00:31:24 How Illness Impacts Testosterone and Estrogen: Cytokines, e.g., IL-6  </p><p>00:33:20 How Exactly Do Behaviors Change Hormones?  </p><p>00:34:18 Pheromones: Miscarriage, Menstrual Cycles, Puberty Onset, and Mate Recognition  </p><p>00:43:33 Apnea: A Powerful Bi-Directional Influence On Estrogen and Testosterone  </p><p>00:47:44 Mouth vs. Nose Breathing and Hormone Levels: Effects Via Sleep and Direct Effects  </p><p>00:51:11 How Sleep Adjusts Cortisol/Testosterone and Cortisol/Estrogen Ratios  </p><p>00:53:49 O2:CO2 Ratios, Nasal Breathing During Exercise  </p><p>00:56:30 Light Viewing Patterns and Hormones: Dopamine, GnRH  </p><p>00:57:44 Spring Fever: Tyrosinase, Hair Color, Mating Frequency  </p><p>01:04:39 Specificity of Hormone Effects  </p><p>01:06:03 Temperature: Cold and Hot Gonads  </p><p>01:14:10 How To Exercise: Types, Effort Level, Sequencing  </p><p>01:21:42 Cardio/Endurance vs. Resistance Training (First or Last?)

      <title>The Science of Sexual Development</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/biological-influences-on-sex-sex-differences-and-preferences?utm_campaign=The+Science+of+Sexual+Development&amp;utm_source=podcast+player&amp;utm_medium=rss+website+link</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how hormones such as testosterone and estrogen and their derivatives impact the early development of the brain and body and their maturation. I review published data on environmental factors shown to powerfully alter hormone pathways in animals and humans and the effects of cannabis, alcohol and cell phones on testes, sperm, ovaries and hormones. I describe the predictable relationship between genes, beard growth and balding patterns, and the importance of estrogen for brain development in people of all chromosomal sexes. Finally, I discuss how the hormones we are exposed to in the womb shape the relative length of our finger digits, the sounds our ears make (yes you read that correctly), and how those correlate with people's self-reports of their sexual preferences. As always, basic information and tools are discussed.

      <title>The Science of Emotions &amp; Relationships</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-emotions-relationships</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss the biology of emotions and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I discuss the biology of <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/topics/emotions-and-relationship-psychology">emotions</a> and moods in the context of relationships. I focus on the science of how early infant-caregiver attachment, combined with adolescence and puberty shape our adult patterns of attachment. I explain the three universal aspects of emotions, the reality of right-brain versus left-brain personalities, and how the roots of adult attachment are also grounded in specific aspects of puberty. I review what factors determine when puberty starts and ends, and the role of oxytocin and other chemicals in controlling how we perceive and remember others. As always, I refer to various practical tools including new tools for understanding and predicting our emotions before they occur, and neurochemicals that shape human connection.</p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/the-science-of-emotions-relationships">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/ag1BC">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/wakingupBC">https://www.wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction  </p><p>00:00:32 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up  </p><p>00:05:10 Announcing New Cost-Free Resources: Captions, NSDR Link  </p><p>00:07:40 Emotions: Subjective Yet Tractable  </p><p>00:10:53 To Understand Your Emotions: Look At Infancy &amp; Puberty  </p><p>00:15:21 Your First Feeling Was Anxiety  </p><p>00:17:36 What Are “Healthy Emotions”?  </p><p>00:19:03 Digital Tool For Predicting Your Emotions: Mood Meter App  </p><p>00:21:08 The Architecture Of A Feeling: (At Least) 3 Key Questions To Ask Yourself  </p><p>00:24:00 You Are An Infant: Bonds &amp; Predictions  </p><p>00:27:57 Attachment Style Hinges On How You Handle Disappointment  </p><p>00:32:40 “Glue Points” Of Emotional Bonds: Gaze, Voice, Affect, Touch, (&amp; Written)  </p><p>00:36:34 “Emotional Health”: Awareness of the Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Dynamic  </p><p>00:37:50 An Exercise: Controlling Interoceptive-Exteroceptive Bias  </p><p>00:42:19 Getting Out Of Your Head: The Attentional Aperture  </p><p>00:46:59 Puberty: Biology &amp; Emotions On Deliberate Overdrive  </p><p>00:47:58 Bodyfat &amp; Puberty: The Leptin Connection  </p><p>00:50:34 Pheromones: Mates, Timing Puberty, Spontaneous Miscarriage  </p><p>00:54:37 Kisspeptin: Robust Trigger Of Puberty &amp; Performance Enhancing Agent  </p><p>00:58:26 Neuroplasticity Of Emotions: Becoming Specialists &amp; Testing Emotional Bonds  </p><p>01:00:25 Testing Driving Brain Circuits For Emotion: Dispersal  </p><p>01:07:48 Science-Based Recommendations for Adolescents and Teens: The Autonomy Buffet  </p><p>01:11:05 “Right-Brain Versus Left-Brain People”: Facts Versus Lies  </p><p>01:14:18 Left Brain = Language, Right Brain = Spatial Awareness  </p><p>01:16:15 How To Recognize “Right Brain Activity” In Speech: Prosody  </p><p>01:18:32 Oxytocin: The Molecule of Synchronizing States  </p><p>01:20:09 Mirror Neurons: Are Not For “Empathy”, Maybe For Predicting Behavior  </p><p>01:23:00 Promoting Trust &amp; Monogamy  </p><p>01:27:00 Ways To Increase Oxytocin  </p><p>01:28:34 Vasopressin: Aphrodisiac, Non-Monogamy and Anti-Bed-Wetting Qualities  </p><p>01:30:43 Bonding Bodies, Not Just Minds: Vagus Nerve, Depression Relief Via the Body  </p><p>01:35:18 A Powerful Tool For Enhancing Range &amp; Depth of Emotional Experience  </p><p>01:36:43 MDMA and Other Psychedelic Compounds: Building A Framework  </p><p>01:38:54 Roundup, Various Forms of Support  </p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>How to Increase Motivation &amp; Drive</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-increase-motivation-and-drive</link>
      <description>This episode explains the science of motivation and drive. I describe how dopamine — a chemical we all make in our brain, underlies our desire for and pursuit of our goals, as well as our capacity to move and experience pleasure. I describe how we can leverage specific behaviors, reward schedules and dopamine-prolactin balance to help ensure we can maintain motivation and capacity for pleasure over the long term. I also discuss dopamine in the context of ADHD, craving and addiction, and some absolutely amazing results about specificity of drug effects based purely on belief.

      <title>How Foods &amp; Nutrients Control Our Moods</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-foods-and-nutrients-control-our-moods</link>
      <description>This episode explains the brain-body connections that allow the specific foods we eat to control our moods and motivation. I discuss the vagus nerve and its role in dopamine and serotonin release in the brain. I review Omega-3 fatty acids and the key role of the gut microbiome in supporting (or hindering) our mental and emotional states. Many actionable tools are reviewed and discussed related to fasting, ketogenic and plant-based diets, probiotics, fermented foods, fish oils, artificial sweeteners, specific supplements that promote dopamine and serotonin, and some remarkable behavioral (and belief) effects.

I review Omega-3 fatty acids and the key role of the gut microbiome in supporting (or hindering) our mental and emotional states. Many actionable tools are reviewed and discussed related to fasting, ketogenic and plant-based diets, probiotics, fermented foods, fish oils, artificial sweeteners, specific supplements that promote dopamine and serotonin, and some remarkable behavioral (and belief) effects.</p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-foods-and-nutrients-control-our-moods">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/huberman">https://www.wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction  </p><p>00:00:31 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up  </p><p>00:05:00 Emotions: Aligning Mind &amp; Body  </p><p>00:06:41 Nutrients, Neurochemicals and Mood  </p><p>00:08:39 Primitive Expressions and Actions  </p><p>00:12:30 The Vagus Nerve: Truth, Fiction, Function  </p><p>00:15:45 “Vagus Stimulation”: A Terrible Concept  </p><p>00:16:35 Polyvagal Theory  </p><p>00:18:27 Vagus Senses Many Things, &amp; Moves Our Organs  </p><p>00:19:35 Sugar Sensing Without Perception of Sweetness  </p><p>00:23:00 Eating-Induced Anxiety  </p><p>00:27:30 We Eat Until Our Brain Perceives “Amino Acid Threshold”  </p><p>00:29:45 Reward Prediction Error: Buildup, Letdown and Wanting More  </p><p>00:32:01 L-Tyrosine, Dopamine, Motivation, Mood, &amp; Movement  </p><p>00:34:04 Supplementing L-Tyrosine, Drugs of Abuse, Wellbutrin  </p><p>00:38:29 Serotonin: Gut, Brain, Satiety and Prozac  </p><p>00:43:38 Eating to Promote Dopamine (Daytime) &amp; Serotonin (Night Time)  </p><p>00:44:30 Supplementing Serotonin: Sleep, &amp; Caution About Sleep Disruptions  </p><p>00:46:40 Examine.com An Amazing Cost-Free Resource with Links to Science Papers  </p><p>00:48:05 Mucuna Pruriens: The Dopamine Bean with a Serotonin Outer Shell  </p><p>00:51:00 Emotional Context and Book Recommendation: “How Emotions Are Made”  </p><p>00:54:55 Exercise: Powerful Mood Enhancer, But Lacks Specificity  </p><p>00:56:45 Omega-3: Omega-6 Ratios, Fish Oil and Alleviating Depression  </p><p>01:01:00 Fish Oil as Antidepressant  </p><p>01:02:40 EPAs May Improve Mood via Heart Rate Variability: Gut-Heart-Brain  </p><p>01:07:24 Alternatives to Fish Oil to Obtain Sufficient Omega-3/EPAs  </p><p>01:09:05 L-Carnitine for Mood, Sperm and Ovary Quality, Autism, Fibromyalgia, Migraine  </p><p>01:16:29 Gut-Microbiome: Myths, Truths &amp; the Tubes Within Us  </p><p>01:21:55 Probiotics, Brain Fog, Autism, Fermentation  </p><p>01:25:20 Artificial Sweeteners &amp; the Gut Microbiome: NOT All Bad; It Depends!  </p><p>01:28:00 Ketogenic, Vegan, &amp; Processed Food Effects, Individual Differences  </p><p>01:33:20 Fasting-Based Depletion of Our Microbiome  </p><p>01:35:20 How Mindset Effects Our Responses to Foods: Amazing (Ghrelin) Effects!  </p><p>01:38:30 How Mindset Controls Our Metabolism  </p><p>01:41:03 Closing Comments, Thanks, Support &amp; Resources  </p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Master Stress: Tools for Managing Stress &amp; Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/tools-for-managing-stress-and-anxiety</link>
      <description>This episode explains what stress is, and how it recruits our brain and body to react in specific ways. I describe the three main types of stress, and how two of them actually enhance the function of our immune system making us less vulnerable to infections. I review tools that allow us to control our stress in real-time, as well as tools to prevent long-term stress, burnout and stress-induced illness and anxiety. As always, we cover behavioral tools and supplements that can assist or hinder stress control.

      <title>Control Pain &amp; Heal Faster With Your Brain</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/control-pain-and-heal-faster-with-your-brain</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe the science of how and why pain arises in the body and brain, and how we can actively control our experience of pain. I discuss inflammation, stress, acupuncture, limb damage and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). I review protocols that leverage the lymphatic and nervous system to accelerate pain relief and healing in a variety of situations. Other topics discussed include how heat versus cold impacts neurons and wounds, red-light, sunlight, stem cells and more.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, I describe the science of how and why pain arises in the body and brain, and how we can actively control our experience of pain. I discuss inflammation, stress, acupuncture, limb damage and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). I review protocols that leverage the lymphatic and nervous system to accelerate pain relief and healing in a variety of situations. Other topics discussed include how heat versus cold impacts neurons and wounds, red-light, sunlight, stem cells and more. </p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/control-pain-and-heal-faster-with-your-brain">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/huberman">https://www.wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction/Avenues for Support  </p><p>00:00:31 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up  </p><p>00:04:58 Deliberate Unlearning  </p><p>00:06:43 Pain, Injury and Regeneration  </p><p>00:09:17 A System of Touch (Somatosensation)  </p><p>00:11:42 Pain and Injury are Dissociable  </p><p>00:15:19 Objective versus Subjective Control of Experience  </p><p>00:16:15 Plasticity of Perception  </p><p>00:16:41 Lack of Pain Is Self-Destructive; So Is Excessive Pain  </p><p>00:18:42 Homoculous, Ratonculous, Dogunculus  </p><p>00:19:05 “Sensitivity” explained  </p><p>00:21:30 Inflammation  </p><p>00:22:24 Phantom Limb Pain  </p><p>00:24:00 Top-down Relief of Pain by Vision  </p><p>00:26:41 From Deaf to Hearing Sounds  </p><p>00:28:10 Pain Is In The Mind &amp; Body  </p><p>00:29:44 Recovering Movement Faster After Injury  </p><p>00:35:00 Don’t Over Compensate  </p><p>00:37:34 Concussion, TBI &amp; Brain Ageing  </p><p>00:40:49 The Brain’s Sewage Treatment System: Glymphatic Clearance  </p><p>00:43:05 Body Position &amp; Angle During Sleep  </p><p>00:44:30 Types of Exercise For Restoring &amp; Maintaining Brain Health  </p><p>00:47:33 Ambulance Cells in The Brain  </p><p>00:49:20 True Pain Control by Belief and Context  </p><p>00:51:45 Romantic Love and Pain  </p><p>00:55:05 Dopaminergic Control of Pain  </p><p>00:57:15 Acupuncture: Rigorous Scientific Assessment  </p><p>01:07:32 Vagus Activation and Autonomic Control of Pain  </p><p>01:08:30 Inflammation, Turmeric, Lead and DHT  </p><p>01:11:40 Adrenalin: Wim Hof, Tummo, “Super-Oxygenation” Breathing  </p><p>01:14:53 Protocols For Accelerating Tissue Repair &amp; Managing Pain  </p><p>01:17:55 Ice Is Not Always Nice (For Pain and Injury): Sludging, Fascia, Etc.  </p><p>01:22:02 Chronic and/or Whole Body Pain; Red-Light Therapy, Sunlight  </p><p>01:26:10 Glymphatics and Sleep  </p><p>01:26:29 Stem Cells, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP): Shams, Shoulds and Should Nots  </p><p>01:31:38 Young Blood: Actual Science  </p><p>01:35:44 Synthesis, Support &amp; Resources</p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>Optimize Your Learning &amp; Creativity With Science-Based Tools</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/optimize-your-learning-and-creativity-with-science-based-tools</link>
      <description>In this episode, I describe how to access focused learning bouts, creative states, and the underlying neural circuitry involved. I frame this in the context of our daily 24-hour cycle in order to make it practical, clear and precise about timing. I review the role of fasting, meal timing and specific types of nutrients for promoting certain states of mind. I also review various other tools and biological factors that directly or indirectly gate brain function and that we can control. I answer commonly asked questions about the science of psychedelics, binaural beats, and visualization. Thank you for your interest in science!

      <title>How to Learn Faster by Using Failures, Movement &amp; Balance</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/using-failures-movement-and-balance-to-learn-faster</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss how we can use specific types of behavior to change our brain, both for sake of learning the movements themselves and for allowing us to learn non-movement-based information as well. I describe the key role that errors play in triggering our brains to change and how the vestibular (balance) system can activate and amplify neuroplasticity. As always, I cover science and science-based practical tools. Thank you in advance for your questions and for your interest in science!

      <title>How to Focus to Change Your Brain</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-to-focus-to-change-your-brain</link>
      <description>This episode introduces neuroplasticity—which is how our brain and nervous system learn and acquire new capabilities. I describe the differences between childhood and adult neuroplasticity, the chemicals involved and how anyone can increase their rate and depth of learning by leveraging the science of focus. I describe specific tools for increasing focus and learning. The next two episodes will cover the ideal protocols for specific types of learning and how to make learning new information more reflexive.

      <title>Understand and Use Dreams to Learn and Forget</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/understanding-and-using-dreams-to-learn-and-to-forget</link>
      <description>This episode is all about the two major kinds of dreams and the sorts of learning and unlearning they are used for. I discuss REM-associated dreams that control emotional learning and their similarity to various trauma treatments such as ketamine and EMDR. I also discuss Non-REM dreams and their role in motor learning and learning of detailed, non-emotionally-laden information. I relate this to science-backed tools for accessing more of the types of sleep and learning people may want. Other topics are listed in the time stamps below.

Other topics are listed in the time stamps below.</p><p>Read the full show notes for this episode at <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/understanding-and-using-dreams-to-learn-and-to-forget">hubermanlab.com</a>.</p><h2>Thank you to our sponsors</h2><p>AG1: <a href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a></p><p>LMNT: <a href="https://go.hubermanlab.com/lmnt-back-catalog">https://drinklmnt.com/hubermanlab</a></p><p>Waking Up: <a href="https://www.wakingup.com/huberman">https://www.wakingup.com/huberman</a></p><h2>Timestamps</h2><p>00:00:00 Introduction  </p><p>00:00:30 Sponsors: AG1, LMNT &amp; Waking Up  </p><p>00:03:00 The Dream Mask  </p><p>00:06:00 Cycling Sleep  </p><p>00:08:10 Chemical Cocktails of Sleep  </p><p>00:13:00 Motor Learning  </p><p>00:16:30 High Performance with Less Sleep  </p><p>00:17:45 Rapid Eye Movement Sleep  </p><p>00:20:30 Paralysis &amp; Hallucinations  </p><p>00:23:35 Nightmares  </p><p>00:24:45 When REM &amp; Waking Collide  </p><p>00:25:00 Sleeping While Awake  </p><p>00:26:45 Alien Abductions  </p><p>00:29:00 Irritability  </p><p>00:30:00 Sleep to Delete  </p><p>00:32:25 Creating Meaning  </p><p>00:34:10 Adults Acting Like Children  </p><p>00:36:20 Trauma &amp; REM  </p><p>00:37:15 EMDR  </p><p>00:39:10 Demo  </p><p>00:44:25 Ketamine / PCP  </p><p>00:45:45 Soup, Explosions, &amp; NMDA  </p><p>00:48:55 Self Therapy  </p><p>00:50:30 Note About Hormones  </p><p>00:51:40 Measuring REM / SWS  </p><p>00:53:15 Sleep Consistency  </p><p>00:56:00 Bed Wetting  </p><p>00:58:00 Serotonin  </p><p>00:59:00 Increasing SWS  </p><p>00:59:50 Lucidity  </p><p>01:02:15 Booze / Weed  </p><p>01:03:50 Scripting Dreams  </p><p>01:04:35 Theory of Mind  </p><p>01:07:55 Synthesis  </p><p>01:10:00 Intermittent Sleep Deprivation  </p><p>01:11:10 Snoring Disclaimer  </p><p>01:11:40 New Topic  </p><p>01:15:50 Corrections  </p><p>01:17:25 Closing Remarks  </p><p><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/disclaimer">Disclaimer &amp; Disclosures</a></p>]]>

      <title>How to Defeat Jet Lag, Shift Work &amp; Sleeplessness</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/find-your-temperature-minimum-to-defeat-jetlag-shift-work-and-sleeplessness</link>
      <description>In this episode, I discuss a simple and reliable measurement called your "temperature minimum" that you can use to rapidly adjust to new time zones when traveling and to offset the bad effects of nocturnal shift work. I also discuss tools for adjusting sleep and waking rhythms in babies, teens, new parents and the elderly.

      <title>How Your Brain Works &amp; Changes</title>
      <link>https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/how-your-nervous-system-works-and-changes</link>
      <description>Today’s episode provides an introduction to how the nervous system works to create sensations, perceptions, emotions, thoughts and behaviors, as well as how we can change our nervous system—a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity. The information sets the stage for all Huberman Lab podcast episodes that follow by covering neurons, synapses, brain chemicals and the rhythms that control our ability to focus, learn and sleep… and more. Thank you for your interest in science. We'll see you next week!
