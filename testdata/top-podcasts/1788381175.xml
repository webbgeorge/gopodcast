    <description>Hi, we're Ben Stiller and Adam Scott. We have severed ourselves from the world for 5 years, making the workplace thriller Severance. While we have no memory of what happened during that time, we thought we should make a companion podcast for all the Innies who will have no recollection of watching, in an attempt to reintegrate them with their memory of the show.
This is the Severance Podcast with Ben Stiller and Adam Scott, an episode-by-episode, behind-the-scenes breakdown with the creators, cast, crew, and fans of the Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning TV show.
In advance of Season 2 premiering January 17 on Apple TV+, director/executive producer Stiller and star/executive producer Scott will rewatch every episode of Season 1 and share in-depth, never-before-heard analysis, alongside guests including creator Dan Erickson, producer Jackie Cohn, stars Zach Cherry ("Dylan"), John Turturro ("Irving") and Britt Lower ("Helly"), and celebrity superfans Jon Stewart, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. The podcast will continue weekly following new episodes of Season 2. From Audacy Podcasts, Audacy's Pineapple Street Studios, Red Hour, and Great Scott. 
If you’ve got a question about Severance, call our hotline at 212-830-3816. We just might play your voicemail and answer your question on the podcast.</description>

      <description>To unpack Season 2 Episode 3, Ben and Adam are joined by Gwendoline Christie, who plays a mysterious new Lumon employee, for her first ever podcast. And she’s a natural! They talk all about her unique acting journey, the power of leaning into the absurd and obscene, and how protective her character is of her department -- the people and the goats. Plus, she reveals the three things she learned about goats while filming Severance: they are highly intelligent, they eat everything, and they are little freaks.
