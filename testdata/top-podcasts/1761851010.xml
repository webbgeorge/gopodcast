      <title>Can the Third Movie in a Franchise EVER Be the Best?</title>
      <description>Welcome to the Bingees Extra Bit! This is an episode dedicated to your comments, questions, and recommendations. In this episode, Alex Jones and Harry Judd are inspired by the debate over whether a third movie in a franchise can outshine its predecessors, exploring classics like Indiana Jones, Toy Story 3, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Listener shoutouts include everything from Gangs of London on Netflix to the Before Trilogy starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, plus a festive nod to Netflix's new Christmas hit, Hot Frosty.

The duo also discuss the gripping drama Curfew on Paramount+ and there’s a listener review in for Gladiator 2. 

Find out what’s binge-worthy or bin-worthy as they give us an espresso shot of joy!

      <title>Did You Spot Daniel Craig in Heartbeat? Plus, Is Gentle Murder a Genre?</title>
      <description>In this episode of the 'Bingees Extra Bit', Alex Jones and Harry Judd go through your questions, listener recommendations, and a cozy stroll down memory lane with nostalgic TV shows and classic films. From “gentle murder shows” like Midsomer Murders and Murder She Wrote to awkward TV moments you wouldn’t dare watch with family (Industry, anyone?).

Alex and Harry also debate whether Dirty Dancing is still a classic, and how you say Mammia Mia - are you Team Alex or Team Harry?

      <title>Is Succession Overrated? And Will Ferrell’s Must-Watch Doc!</title>
      <description>Harry and Alex chat about their weekly watchlist to help you sort through the overwhelming amount of content out there. Harry's raving about series 2 of Colin from Accounts (BBC iPlayer), a hilarious Australian comedy where love and chaos bloom after a nipple-flashing accident, while Alex has been gripped by a touching new Will Ferrell documentary, Will &amp; Harper (Netflix). Plus, they debate Succession (Sky) – is it binge-worthy or overrated? And don’t miss Alex's tale with Tom Jones and Harry's dad's feedback on the first episode!

Binge-Worthy:

Will &amp; Harper (Netflix)

Strictly Come Dancing (BBC iPlayer)

Beef (Netflix)


Bin-Worthy:
Eric (Netflix)

Homework:
For Alex: Watch Mr. Inbetween (Disney+) 
For Harry: Watch Slow Horses (Apple TV+) – listener Emily's recommendation. 
Forfeit: Watch Sharknado (Amazon Prime) as punishment for incomplete homework!
