      <title>That's that on imposter syndrome</title>
      <description>Hey there! 

On today’s show: In an 8-and-a-half-minute-long TikTok video, Mikaela Testa has accused Anna Paul of some pretty gnarly things. And US Bachelor star Rachael Kirkconnell has gone on Call Her Daddy to talk all about that weird breakup post… We’re diving into all of it in a jam-packed Welcome To My Algorithm. And later: let’s unpack the viral clip of a successful woman saying she’s never had imposter syndrome: because for some reason, that’s apparently a bit controversial… 

Huge thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode of Shameless possible. Their new performance range, Proform, is available now. Shop it online, in-store or via the app and use SHAMELESS10 for 10% off. 

On today’s episode, Mich recommended Bohnanza.

This episode was audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>A fake love story (and a very real one)</title>
      <description>Hiiii hi hi!

On today’s show: Setting the record straight on those Barack Obama/Jennifer Aniston rumours, Gracie Abrams defends her opening act from bizarre stan culture, and then, Triple J’s Hottest 100 came around again, so how relevant in 2025 is both the countdown and the youth radio station in general? Plus, Robert Pattinson trolls the press once more. And then, 2025’s first Slow News Week!!!!

This week Mich recommended Richard Scolyer’s episode of Patient Zero on Australian Story/ABC iView. Zara recommended reading Mark Manson’s 40 Lessons at 40, as well as ‘How Mecca outfoxed Sephora in Australia’ from Style-ish podcast.

This episode was audio-produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to KX Pilates for making this episode possible. Use the code ‘LETSGO’ on the intro offer you can get 5 classes for $50. Just head to kxpilates.com or download the KX Pilates App to find a class near you.

      <title>A quick and dirty with aplomb!</title>
      <description>Hi hi hi!

Today on the show, it’s the Quick and Dirty to end all Quick and Dirties! We’re diving into all the headlines we missed over the break. Like… Brad and Ange’s divorce has finally been settled, Vanity Fair are wondering whether or not Harry and Meghan are even interesting anymore, Zendaya and Tom Holland are engaged, Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster made their public debut as a couple and… Adrian Portelli’s 50k controversy…

On this episode, Zara recommended In Memorium by Alice Winn. Mich recommended Margot’s Got Money Troubles by Rufi Thorpe.

This episode of Shameless is brought to you by Cerave’s Facial Moisturiser with SPF 50. 

Listen to The TikTok Flop from The Daily. 

This episode was audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>It... doesn't end</title>
      <description>Hiiii hi hi! We’re back on board, baby!

Which of course means that on today’s show, it’s time for us to unpack all of those It Ends With Us developments. We’ll be discussing everything from Blake Lively’s sexual assault allegations against Justin Baldoni, to Justin Baldoni’s $400 million countersuit. There’s so much to discuss that we’re going to spend a whole damn episode on it.

This week, Mich and Zara came through with a lotttaaaa book recs! They’re all linked below:

The Wedding People by Alison Espach

Rytual by Chloe Elisabeth Wilson


The Safekeep by Yael van der Wouden 

Real Americans by Rachel Khong


This episode was audio-produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Summer Scandal: Brad, Jen, and Angelina</title>
      <description>Hi!

We’re back again for another scandal summer special, and this time, we’re reminiscing on the Brangelina story. This is the Jen, Brad, and Ange series. Brad and Angelina? They were the golden couple, then the power couple, and then… it all came crashing down. The fallout? It’s still ongoing, and we’ve got the updates for you.

Big thanks to Betty’s Burgers for making this episode of Shameless possible.

      <title>Do words of the year even mean anything?</title>
      <description>Hey! 

On today’s show: ‘brain rot’, ‘enshittification’, ‘polarisation’, ‘demure’, ‘manifest’ - what do all these words have in common? Well, they’ve each been tapped as candidates for 2024’s Word of the Year. These are the words that, allegedly, encapsulate the vibe and cultural mood of 2024. But do these words actually… mean anything?

This week, Zara recommended The Gentleman From Peru by Andre Aciman. Mich recommended ‘How Does My Divorce Make You Feel?’ in The Cut.

Big thanks to the 2025 Australian Open for making this episode possible. The Ground Pass is a good shout – you can wander the Garden Square eateries by day, or even head in for drinks after work. Purchase your AO25 Ground Pass from just $35 by visiting Ticketmaster.com.au. 

This episode was audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>The friends we keep...</title>
      <description>Hey there! 

Today on the show: as more and more allegations against Diddy come to light, it appears that his powerful friends are not immune either. Jay Z, a longtime friend of Diddy’s, has just been accused of rape; and whether or not he’s guilty, it doesn’t change the fact that he’s been friends with Diddy for decades. So we want to know: how much can you judge a person’s character based on the friends they keep? 

This episode of Shameless is brought to you by SIX The Musical, which is heading back to Sydney! 

On today’s show, Mich recommended Paris Hilton &amp; Nicole Richie: Queens of the 2000s from Call Her Daddy. You can also listen to The Daily’s interview with Alex Cooper here.

You can read “Get in loser, we’re cancelling the assassin for thinking The Anxious Generation was good” from Smart, Dumb Stuff here. While you’re there, you can also subscribe to Smart, Dumb Stuff. ;)

This episode was audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>The "sad, beige" influencer lawsuit</title>
      <description>Well hello!

Today on the show, we’re discussing the "sad, beige" influencer rivalry that has now escalated into a full-blown lawsuit. Can the legal system protect the ‘vibe’ of a creator? Even if that vibe is… kinda basic? And later, we’re talking about whether or not being an influencer is hard work. Again!

This episode of Shameless is brought to you by Elite Eleven, your one-stop shop for all your last-minute Christmas shopping. We also want to thank SIX The Musical, which is heading back to Sydney! 

This episode was audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

Today on the show, we’re discussing the "sad, beige" influencer rivalry that has now escalated into a full-blown lawsuit. Can the legal system protect the ‘vibe’ of a creator? Even if that vibe is… kinda basic? And later, we’re talking about whether or not being an influencer is hard work. Again!

This episode of Shameless is brought to you by Elite Eleven, your one-stop shop for all your last-minute Christmas shopping. We also want to thank SIX The Musical, which is heading back to Sydney! 

This episode was audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <description>Hello hello!

On today’s show: after their infamous diss track battle, Drake is suing Kendrick Lamar’s record label… which just so happens to be his own record label. Why did Billboard issue an apology to Taylor Swift?, we give a crash course on the Nepo Baby Ball in Paris, a very important timeline on the reported fallout between Hillary Duff and her sister, and then! We play Slow News Week.

This week, Zara recommended watching Borgen on Netflix. Mich recommended reading ‘An I.V.F. Mix-Up, a Shocking Discovery and an Unbearable Choice’ in The New York Times.

      <title>What does a 30-something look like?</title>
      <description>Hello hello! 

On today’s show: we want to talk about a new op-ed that’s just been published on The Cut titled 'What Should a 30-Something Look Like?' Because between all the Botox injections, and the TikTok For You Page, it kind of feels like we’ve lost touch with how we’re supposed to look once we hit thirty. And it’s not just women who feel this way, either!

This episode of Shameless is brought to you by the NEW CeraVe AM Facial Moisturising Lotion with SPF50.

This episode was audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

On today’s show, Zara recommended Kiera Knightley: ‘Turning 40? It looks rather great’ from The Times.

      <title>Ariana, Ethan and the three steps to PR recovery</title>
      <description>Hiiii, everyone!

On the show: Just over a year ago, the world found out about Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s new relationship, and fans were… outraged. It was a PR nightmare that threatened to take the Wicked movie down with it, a la Don’t Worry Darling. But now, one year on… and days ahead of the film’s premiere… have they done the impossible and turned it all around? Plus! Speaking of controversial relationships, we have an update on those Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster headlines…

This week, Zara recommended watching Press on Amazon Prime!

Big thanks to Australia Post for making this episode possible. The AusPost app automatically adds all of your deliveries to your account, so you can track it all in one place. And with 2-hour delivery notifications you can stay on top of it all! Get on it and download the AusPost app today.

      <title>Rejecting $12 million</title>
      <description>Hello hello!

On today’s show: Brianna Lapaglia accuses Zach Bryan of emotional abuse and says she rejected his team’s offer of $12 million to keep quiet. Plus, the celeb lookalike contests are out of control, the Grammys noms are out and there are a few key snubs, Paul Mescal doesn’t want to become too famous, and meet the billionaire who just bought The Block.

This week, Mich recommended Heston Blumenthal: ‘I was manic. My wife put me in hospital’ in the Sunday Times. And also! Her new favourite free-to-air show: Deal or No Deal.

Big thanks to Hubbl for making this episode possible. Right now, you can get 50% off Hubbl Hub to celebrate Black Friday! This offer lasts until the 8th of December so now is the perfect time there’s no better time to upgrade your Smart TV. 

And thank you to Four Pillars for supporting this episode of Shameless! This summer, enjoy a Four Pillars G&amp;T, with orange. And remember to drink wise.

      <title>The true crime conundrum</title>
      <description>Hello!

Today on the show, Anna Kendrick told the world that she’s donating the profits from her new film, Woman of the Hour, to charity. Which got us thinking: true crime content has never been more popular, but how ethical is it, really? Oh, and Mich tells us all about Dave Portnoy’s Zach Bryan diss track. 

This episode of Shameless is brought to you by Airbnb. 

On today’s show, Zara recommended All Those A-List Celebs Couldn’t Save Harris, But Joe Rogan Helped Trump from The Hollywood Reporter.

And here’s Anna Kendrick on Armchair Expert.

      <title>Red flag hunters</title>
      <description>Why helloooo, everyone!

On today’s show: Channing Tatum and Zoë Kravitz called off their engagement on the heels of their PR tour. Cynthia Erivo says she should’ve called her friends instead, the public voted for the world’s sexiest musician and in doing so, failed the culture, Olivia Rodrigo’s tip for finding red flags, and can you name the biggest musician in the world right now? We chart his curious rise back to the top.

This week, Zara recommended listening to Rivals: The Official Podcast by Wondery. Mich recommended The Ad Campaign by The Daily.

This episode was audio produced by Eilish Gilligan and Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Bringing OnlyFans to O-Week</title>
      <description>Hi hi! Today on the show, everyone in the Shameless Media office is talking about Bonnie Blue, the controversial OnlyFans creator and social media influencer with a… erm… unique approach to her work. This unique approach definitely sets her apart… but is it ethical?

And later, The Hollywood Reporter just published its 2024 Creator A-List, and when it comes to social media, anyone who’s anyone is on that list. But in 2024, what makes an influencer truly influential? 

This episode of Shameless is brought to you by the new CeraVe AM Facial Moisturising Lotion with SPF50, now available at Chemist Warehouse. 

Your Shameless hosts are Zara McDonald (@zamcdonald) and Michelle Andrews (@michelleandrews1). This episode was researched and audio-produced by Eilish Gilligan.

On today’s show, Mich recommended Katie Price on The Louis Theroux Podcast. Zara recommended Spotify’s DJ X feature.

On today’s show: the star of Wicked Cynthia Erivo slammed fans’ homemade artwork, and the response has been rather intense. Industry names call for an age-restriction to joining musical groups in the wake of Liam Payne’s death, Andrew Garfield might’ve just fallen in love and it sadly wasn’t with Nana Bot Lee, and Zara welcomes you to her algorithm.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>The death of Liam Payne</title>
      <description>Hello!

On today’s show: former One Direction star Liam Payne has died, so how do we make sense of his death as both a beloved teen idol as well as a man accused of inflicting pain on women? And then, the Victoria’s Secret fashion show is back! So what did we make of the spectacle?

This week, Zara recommended Sunday Sports Club with Alison Kuch. Mich recommended Mr Big from ABC Podcasts: new Unravelled series.

This episode was audio produced by Eilish Gilligan.

Big thanks to frank green, Australia’s most loved reusable brand, for making this episode possible.

      <title>Sabrina Carpenter and how to nail a year</title>
      <description>Hiiii!

This week, Zara recommended The Fin podcast: Succession parts one and two. Mich recommended watching James Acaster’s cold lasagne hate myself 1999.

Big thanks to Elite Eleven’s new Spring/Summer collection for making this episode possible.

      <title>Remember When... Gossip Girl was it?</title>
      <description>Happy Saturday, everybody!

Welcome to the final episode of REMEMBER WHEN, where we analyse the most intriguing celebrity stories to ever come out of New York City.

Today, we’re retracing the (Met) steps of a classic: Gossip Girl. The heart of this show lives in New York City, so we thought we’d pay our respects to the most iconic NYC locations as seen in the show, while giving you the goss on what went down behind the scenes. 

Big thanks to ING for making this episode possible. Travel and save with an ING Orange Everyday card - search ‘ING Orange Everyday’ before your next trip.

This episode was researched and audio produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>The most famous gyno in the world</title>
      <description>Hiyaaaa!

On today’s show: How do we feel about the most famous gynaecologist in the world being profiled by The Cut? Conflicted, I think! And then, Mich has a kind of My Two Cents that she’s been sitting with for a little while now with all of this in mind… how do we feel about celebrities and their flippant comments about surrogacy? But first, Zara, what are you recommending this week?

      <title>Remember When... we went to Late Night?</title>
      <description>Helloooooo! Happy Saturday!!!!!

Welcome to the third episode of REMEMBER WHEN. This episode is going to be a little different to our last couple of New York eps. 

Basically, when we decided to go to NY, we knew we had to get in the audience for a late night talk show. Or, you know, any American talk show. Day or night. And we wanted to take you along for the journey!

Big thanks to Maybelline New York for making this episode possible. To celebrate Australia’s #1 makeup brand, Priceline is taking 50% off the entire Maybelline range but only until the 9th of October, while stocks last. Head here to purchase!

This episode was researched and audio produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>Are you cool enough for the new Sally Rooney novel?</title>
      <description>Welcome to our brand new Monday episodes!

Coming up on today’s show: Are you cool enough for the new Sally Rooney novel? Are we cool enough for it? Is anyone? Advance copies of Sally Rooney’s new novel Intermezzo have become a surprise status symbol, and we want to know - what would Sally, someone who famously eschews fame, think about it all?

And then: the column that made us think and feel a lot about womanhood, and writing, and mining your personal life for content.

This episode of Shameless was brought to you by Libra. Libra understands the full reality of your experiences and designs solutions with their real needs in mind.

Read 'Are You Cool Enough For The New Sally Rooney Novel?" from Esquire here. Subscribe to Bri Lee's Substack here.

This week, Zara recommended a talk with suki waterhouse. Mich recommended How Telegram Became The Underworld's Favourite App.

This episode was audio produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>The interview that shouldn't have happened</title>
      <description>Hi hi hiiii!

On today’s show: the viral and highly controversial Hayden Panettiere interview that fans say should be pulled from the internet. Then, Charlie Puth makes quite the chic groom, Ashton Kutcher’s old quotes about P Diddy’s parties resurface, Olivia Munn and John Mulaney’s surprise baby, Anna Delvey’s dancing in an ankle bracelet, and then we play clickbait of the week.

This week, Mich recommended watching The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives on Disney+, and then reading ‘A Fashion Psychoanalysis of 'The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives'’ in PAPER Magazine. Zara recommended ‘Why You Can’t Get a Restaurant Reservation’ in the New Yorker.

Big thanks to FRANKIE4 for making this episode possible. FRANKIE4 is giving Shameless listeners 20% off the ‘Eternal Summer’ collection. Simply use the code ‘F4_SHAMELESS20’ at the checkout on frankie4.com or at one of their nine retail stores across Australia, until the 13th of October.

      <title>Remember When... Diana went to lunch?</title>
      <description>Why hello! It’s us, in your feeds on a Saturday!

We are so excited to bring you this very special series REMEMBER WHEN, where we analyse the most intriguing celebrity stories to ever come out of New York City.

“Monday, June 23, 1997. The Four Seasons, East Fifty-second Street, between Lexington and Park. At the invitation of Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, lunch with the Princess of Wales.”

That is how editor, author and royals expert Tina Brown opened her profile on Princess Diana for The New Yorker, and today, we’re looking back on this fateful lunch - we’re even going to take you right to the exact location it took place.

      <itunes:summary>Why hello! It’s us, in your feeds on a Saturday!

We are so excited to bring you this very special series REMEMBER WHEN, where we analyse the most intriguing celebrity stories to ever come out of New York City.

“Monday, June 23, 1997. The Four Seasons, East Fifty-second Street, between Lexington and Park. At the invitation of Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, lunch with the Princess of Wales.”

That is how editor, author and royals expert Tina Brown opened her profile on Princess Diana for The New Yorker, and today, we’re looking back on this fateful lunch - we’re even going to take you right to the exact location it took place.

      <title>Won't somebody think of the children?</title>
      <description>Hello, everybody!

On today’s show: well we’re in New YAWK, so let’s talk about it! Then, we need to unpack the New Yorker’s think piece on “the desperation of the Instagram photo dump.” Plus, Dave Grohl’s had a baby with someone who… isn’t his wife… Barry Keoghan gives some clunky quotes about his son, JLo and Ben Affleck reportedly kissed at a restaurant, Diddy is officially coming undone, and welcome to Mich’s algorithm.

This week, Zara recommended ‘Born Into Fame, This Actress Could Soon Have More of Her Own’ in the New York Times. Mich recommended Kate Lindsay’s latest Embedded column, ‘Yes, the internet is getting meaner’.

Big thanks to Aperol for making this episode possible. To grab tickets to Shameless Trivia, keep an eye out for our socials! And for those who can't make it, don't worry because Aperol is still shouting everyone an Aperol Spritz. All you have to do is order an Aperol Spritz anywhere in Australia and upload a valid receipt using the MYY APP to get up to $21 digital cashback.

      <title>The Belle Gibson story: Part two</title>
      <description>Hiiii!

Welcome to the second part of our series tracking Belle Gibson. In part one, she had just launched her app The Whole Pantry, and it was going extremely well for her. She was telling people that she was a 23-year-old mum with terminal brain cancer. And then, it all unfolded.

Just a content note before you listen: this series might be difficult listening to those with cancer, or those with loved ones who have cancer.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee. 

Big thanks to Yoplait Protein for making this episode possible – protein-packed yoghurt that is creamy, fruity, and helps you stay fuller for longer compared to a low-protein food.

      <title>Defeating the boomer allegations rn</title>
      <description>Hiiiii!

On today’s show: what do we make of those headlines about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift having a relationship contract? Lady Gaga is uncharacteristically open about her relationship, Selena Gomez hits billionaire status, Prince William is hot again, and we play ‘Are you Smarter than a Clickbaiter’ with a familiar face…

This week, Zara recommended Tash Oakley on the podcast Working Hard, Hardly Working. Also!!! The Perfect Couple on Netflix! Mich recommended listening to the podcast Karen by Wondery.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to CeraVe’s Blemish Control Range for making this episode possible. For products that support the skin’s moisture barrier – and your social calendar – check out CeraVe’s Blemish Control Range.

      <description>G’day!!!!

On today’s show: Literally, so much. Chappell Roan hits the headlines again – so is it a case of fair critique, or an instance of tall poppy syndrome? Elle Macpherson’s new interview is giving us flashbacks to 2014, Lana Del Rey may or may not be in love with an alligator tour guide, Olivia Rodrigo and Louis Partridge are the new Gen Z obsession, is Selena Gomez engaged, and then!!! We play slow news week… despite it really not being a slow news week at all.

This week, Mich recommended The “Ketamine Queen” and Matthew Perry’s Hollywood in Vanity Fair, as well as this piece in The Wall Street Journal. Zara recommended watching the Oasis doco called Supersonic, as well as listening to the podcast, The Rest is Politics.

      <title>Katy Perry's confusing career: Part three</title>
      <description>Hi hiiiiii!

It’s the third and final part of our series on Katy Perry. We’re kicking off this last episode by zooming in on the beginning of 2015. Katy was about 31 years old at this point, she was single, and she was right in the middle of the Prismatic world tour.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to OnePass for making this episode possible. All you have to do is head here, fill out a quick form and grab that $20 membership. This is a limited-time offer, so make sure to get in quick.

      <title>She deserves a better man! Or no man at all!</title>
      <description>Hello hello!!!!

On today’s show: Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury’s split, and the curious report from one tabloid that might just give insight into what went wrong. Then! Are Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan over, there’s an update to the claims that Taylor Swift is “blocking” other artists from the charts, Chappel Roan slams fans for their entitlement, Doja Cat just snagged her long-time internet crush, and then! We play Slow News Week. 

This week, Zara had two recommendations! Stormzy’s Day In The Life TikTok, as well as ‘Will Your Friendship Pass the Bridesmaid Test?’ from The Cut. Mich recommended watching Fake on Paramount+.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Thank you so much to AFLW for making this episode possible. The 2024 NAB AFLW Season is starting on Friday, August 30 and we can’t wait to see you at the W! Head here to grab your tickets now.

      <itunes:summary>Hello hello!!!!

On today’s show: Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury’s split, and the curious report from one tabloid that might just give insight into what went wrong. Then! Are Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan over, there’s an update to the claims that Taylor Swift is “blocking” other artists from the charts, Chappel Roan slams fans for their entitlement, Doja Cat just snagged her long-time internet crush, and then! We play Slow News Week. 

This week, Zara had two recommendations! Stormzy’s Day In The Life TikTok, as well as ‘Will Your Friendship Pass the Bridesmaid Test?’ from The Cut. Mich recommended watching Fake on Paramount+.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Thank you so much to AFLW for making this episode possible. The 2024 NAB AFLW Season is starting on Friday, August 30 and we can’t wait to see you at the W! Head here to grab your tickets now.

      <title>Our review of the It Ends With Us movie</title>
      <description>Why hello! Happy Saturday!!!

Welcome to the first episode of a monthly series we’ll be running here in the Shameless feed: reviews of the zeitgeist moments that everyone’s talking about. 

On today’s show: we saw It Ends With Us. Given this is the film adaptation of the book that’s sold over 8 million copies, gained 1 billion BookTok tags, and spawned about a trillion opinions… what better place to start than right here? If you want background on the drama between the actors, listen to our last episode. Here, we’re reviewing the film itself! So, we’ll only be chatting about Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni in the context of them being actors.

Big thanks to SIX the Musical for making this episode possible. Don’t miss out - get your tickets right here and experience SIX for yourself. Thank us later!

Your hosts today were Michelle Andrews (@michelleandrews1), Zara McDonald (@zamcdonald) and Eilish Gilligan (@eilishgilligan).

This episode was audio produced by Eilish Gilligan.

      <title>The ‘It Ends With Us’ mess</title>
      <description>Heeeeey!

On today’s show: obviously, the ‘It Ends With Us’ feud… it feels like the internet has turned on star actress Blake Lively this week, so let's untangle why that’s the case and what we think is going on. Then! Australia has a new face of breakdancing, Raygun, Taylor Swift cancels three Vienna shows, it turns out Drake and Serena Williams were once a thing, and we hope you’re all keeping things very demure, very mindful, very cutesy.

This week, Zara recommended ​​reading ‘Daisy Edgar-Jones Is the Summer’s Breakout Star. Can She Be the Next Julia Roberts?’ in Variety. Mich recommended Orna Guralnik on Armchair Expert.

To read that article in the ABC that Zara mentioned in today’s episode, head here.

Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. Get your CeraVe cleanser online or at your local Chemist Warehouse and start your journey to healthy-looking skin today.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>13 Reasons Why</title>
      <description>Hello!

In October 2015, Netflix purchased a 13-episode series adaptation of 13 Reasons Why, executive-produced by none other than then-24-year-old pop star Selena Gomez. Today, we’re deep-diving how it all played out.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Ruby Hall.

Big thanks to ING for making this episode possible. With ING’s Orange Everyday and Savings Maximiser, you’re all set. Remember, these steps can help you make bank the ING way. Ready to get started? Just search “ING Make Bank” and you’re on your way. 
(The legal stuff: This figure is based on customer data between April 2023 to April 2024. The potential benefits of these two products depend on variable factors and eligibility criteria. This is not financial advice and ING recommends you seek independent financial advice. T&amp;Cs apply. ING ABN 24 000 893 292 and AFSL 229823.)

      <title>Chart wars</title>
      <description>Hellooooo!

On today’s show: Charli XCX and Billie Eilish just released the sexiest song we can remember, and is there any truth to the claims Taylor Swift is trying to block them from the charts? Ballerina Farm’s Hannah Neeleman responds to the internet commentary about her trad wife lifestyle, what the hell is the “fake runner influencer” drama, Cardi B is divorcing Offset and having a third baby, Mich has new thoughts on the relevancy death of The Kardashians, and then! We play Clickbait of the Week.

This week, Mich recommended ‘Living with my husband’s dead wife’ by Amy Paturel in The Cut. Zara recommended Laurence Leamer’s book Capote's Women: The book behind TV's FEUD: CAPOTE VS THE SWANS, as well as Lead Us Not by Abbey Lay.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee, Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald.

Big thanks to Betty’s Burgers and their NEW Luxe $16 Betty’s Bowls for making this episode possible. If you’re ready for a gourmet dining experience, head to your nearest Betty’s Burgers or download the Betty’s app and try their new Luxe $16 Betty’s Bowls today.

      <description>Hiiiii hi hi! We’re back!

On today’s show: A LOT. Starting with Ice Spice and Central Cee’s supposed affair, Margot Robbie’s extremely A-lister pregnancy announcement, Stormzy and Maya Jama are over, what’s the deal with those Cody Ko and Tana Mongeau allegations?, Hailey Bieber’s curious quotes about her family, why the TikTokker behind Ballerina Farm is the fixation of the internet right now, Suki Waterhouse hints her relationship with Bradley Cooper was “dark”, and spare your thoughts for the country singer who revealed… a little more than she planned… on stage.

This week, Zara recommended All Fours by Miranda July and Long Island Compromise by Taffy Brodesser-Akner. Mich recommended Here One Moment by Liane Moriarty.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to the new movie ‘It Ends With Us’ for making this episode possible. Mark your calendars because ‘It Ends with Us’ is in cinemas from August 8th. Head here to book!

      <description>Happppy Monday!

It’s the second and final part of our series on Liam Payne. He’s known for being the overly confident… and yes, cocky… former member of One Direction. But life after the band - including two controversial age-gap relationships - has been littered with headlines.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode possible. Head into one of the Elite Eleven stores now or visit the brand new flagship store from the 27th of July and use ‘SHAMELESS10’ for 10% off.

Want to support our show? Clicking ‘follow’ on Apple and Spotify is the best way to do that, and we're super grateful to anyone who leaves a five-star review while they're at it. Also! An old-fashioned 'Tell a Friend In Real Life' is equally appreciated.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>An excuse to yap forever and ever</title>
      <description>Hello hello!

On today’s show: the popular TikTok that says if you don’t like your mates’ social posts, you’re a bit of a shit friend. Then, a crash course on the Brooke Schofield and Clinton Kane controversy, are Paul Mescal and Gracie Abrams dating? Emma Roberts has a rebuttal to all the nepo baby critique, and what on earth is the deal with Hawk Tuah girl? Then, we play 'Are You SMARTER Than a Clickbait Headline?'

This week, Zara recommended watching A Family Affair on Netflix. Mich recommended reading ‘The Irresolvable Tragedy of the Karen Read Case’ by Jessica Winter in The New Yorker.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Hairhouse and their incredible Electrical Event for making this episode possible. Flaunt Your Power this July with their biggest Electrical Event of the year. Head to your local Hairhouse store or shop online now.

We’re far from being a true crime podcast. But… what about… celebrity true crime? Because Martha Stewart went from a billion-dollar brand to life behind bars. So, let’s retrace how it happened.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. Visit your local store or check online for CeraVe’s Hydrating Cleanser, Moisturising Lotion, and the Advanced Repair Balm.

      <title>The web they weave...</title>
      <description>Oh hiiii!

On today’s show: Charli XCX and Lorde work it out on the remix, why the world is obsessed with Chappell Roan, Travis Kelce went on stage at the Eras Tour and the internet is yet to recover, and Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes’s daughter Suri has ditched “Cruise” from her surname. Then, Zara comes to the table with a ‘My Two Cents’.

This week, Zara recommended an episode of Fashion People called ‘Condéology’. Mich recommended Gracie Abram’s new album: The Secret of Us.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Xero for making this episode possible. If you want to free up your time to focus on the things you love, head to Xero today.

      <title>Oh, James Corden: Part three</title>
      <description>Hello, friends!

It’s the third and final part of our series on James Corden. A man who we’ve mentioned on our Thursday episodes so very many times, yet have never quite known how to place. So, how did his reputation become so… muddled? And is the criticism fair?

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Fly Me To The Moon for making this episode possible. Fly Me To The Moon hits cinemas on July 11, so don’t miss it! Watch the trailer here.

      <title>TikTok’s most talked-about husband</title>
      <description>Hiiii hi hi!

On today’s show: it’s Charli XCX’s moment – and newsflash for the basic girlies: it’s been her moment for a while now. J Lo and Ben Affleck are selling their $91 million home, Sabrina Carpenter casts her boyfriend as her leading man, Lady Gaga clears up that she isn’t pregnant – she’s just down bad crying at the gym, and we play Slow News Week! 

This week, Zara recommended Leo Woodall and Nicholas Galitzine's Actors on Actors interview and the TV show Alice and Jack on Binge. Mich recommended How to Rob a Bank on Netflix and this week’s episode of Style-ish called ‘How DISSH went from Pac Fair to the world’.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode possible. Download the Elite Eleven app today from the App Store or Google Play to search, browse, add to your wishlist, and check it all out with just a few taps. Remember to use the code ‘SHAMELESS10’ for 10% off!

      <itunes:summary>Hiiii hi hi!

On today’s show: it’s Charli XCX’s moment – and newsflash for the basic girlies: it’s been her moment for a while now. J Lo and Ben Affleck are selling their $91 million home, Sabrina Carpenter casts her boyfriend as her leading man, Lady Gaga clears up that she isn’t pregnant – she’s just down bad crying at the gym, and we play Slow News Week! 

This week, Zara recommended Leo Woodall and Nicholas Galitzine's Actors on Actors interview and the TV show Alice and Jack on Binge. Mich recommended How to Rob a Bank on Netflix and this week’s episode of Style-ish called ‘How DISSH went from Pac Fair to the world’.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Oh, James Corden: Part one</title>
      <description>Happy Monday!

Welcome to the first episode of our James Corden series. A man who we’ve mentioned on our Thursday episodes so very many times, yet have never quite known how to place. So, how did his reputation become so… muddled? And is the criticism fair?

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Betty’s Burgers for making this episode possible. They have a new limited edition $15 Glazed Pork Belly Burger! How good?! Head to Betty’s Burgers and treat yourself to the Glazed Pork Belly Burger before it’s too late.

      <title>Daytime TV that raised us: Dr. Phil</title>
      <description>Oh hey!

It’s the final episode of our ‘ Daytime TV that raised us’ series, and today, we’re deep-diving Dr. Phil. A man so recognisable we can say his name and you’ll probably hear his voice, his trademark straight-talking advice. He was total ratings gold. He was also, perhaps unsurprisingly, an incredibly complicated character.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. Hit up their online store or swing by Chemist Warehouse to stock up and keep your skin glowing all winter long.

      <title>The 9-5 is officially in</title>
      <description>Hiyaaaa!

On today’s show: quite a bit, actually! Molly-Mae Hague’s Ryanair flight has people rather grumpy. Plus, the New York Times has set out to determine just how Taylor Swift measures up to the greatest music icons in history, Billie Eilish calls three-hour concerts “psychotic”, Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner are back… on? Glenn Powell is leaving Hollywood. And then! There’s more! Zara’s got a ‘My Two Cents’ on working influencers and we play ‘Are You Smarter Than a Clickbait Headline?’.

This week, Zara recommended New Girl and this interview with Anne Twist on Spinning Plates. Mich recommended Severance on Apple TV (specifically episode nine!!!), and also Kate Hudson on Call Her Daddy.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee and Ruby Hall.

Big thanks to Pureology for making this episode possible. You can find it online at Adore Beauty, or in your local Pureology salon.

      <title>Daytime TV that raised us: Judge Judy</title>
      <description>Oh hi, everyone!

She’s the straight-talking judge who was beamed into living rooms every weekday for years. If you’re a 90s kid, Judge Judy was a TV staple. So, what went into creating it? And who is its central star, Judith Scheindlin?

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Well baby you can lose it overnight</title>
      <description>G’day, everyone!

On today’s show: the Bennifer divorce rumours and what we make of them. Sophie Turner talks to VOGUE about the fallout of her split from Joe Jonas, the ‘It Ends With Us’ trailer is here and it looks… surprisingly good, CCTV footage of Diddy assaulting Cassie is leaked to the media, Harry Styles is probably single again, and Jeremy Clarkson is the hottest man in the UK! Apparently!

This week, Mich recommended Billie Eilish’s latest album, ‘HIT ME HARD AND SOFT’. Zara recommended the podcast AdMission, as well as Bridgerton S3, P1 on Netflix.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Dan’s Daily for making this episode possible. If you’re over 18, head to dansdaily.com.au now to discover the inside word on drinks. And as always, remember to drink responsibly.

      <title>Daytime TV that raised us: Jerry Springer</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone!

Welcome to the first episode of our Scandal series, ‘Daytime TV that raised us’. First up: Jerry Springer. It was one of the trashiest television shows we watched growing up. And the man behind it? Well, he was rather complex. So, what went into creating it?

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. You can easily shop them online or at your nearest Chemist Warehouse store to stock up and keep your skin glowing all winter long.

      <title>She’s wearing a cape</title>
      <description>Helloooo!

On today’s show: Hailey Bieber is pregnant! And her announcement with Justin Bieber was pretty delightful. What can the TV show of the year - Baby Reindeer - teach us about storytelling and fact vs fiction? Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie are a duo again, what the hell happened on the set of the new Mad Max movie – and what are we to make of Anya Taylor Joy’s quotes? Plus! Meet Clickbait of the Week, a new segment we’re trying on.

As we mentioned at the very top of this episode, if you are looking for ways to donate, head here for the link to CharityWatch - an independent charity watchdog - with options that you can consider.

This week, Zara recommended ‘The Complicated Sisterhood of Jackie Kennedy and Lee Radziwill’ in Vanity Fair. Mich recommended ‘Can I Just Quit Therapy?’ by Melissa Dahl in The Cut.

To read ‘Mad Max: Fury Road: The Oral History of a Modern Action Classic’ in The New York Times, head here.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Australian Red Cross Lifeblood for making this episode possible. All you have to do is search ‘give blood’ and sign up to book a donation with Lifeblood today.

      <title>Harry and Meghan: Part three</title>

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Bridgerton S3, P1 for making this episode possible. This season will be released in two parts, the first part on 16 May, and the second part on 13 June. Only on Netflix! Grab all the Bridgerton fans in your life and mark your calendars.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and Chloe Wilson, and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Bridgerton S3, P1 for making this episode possible. This season will be released in two parts, the first part on 16 May, and the second part on 13 June. Only on Netflix! Grab all the Bridgerton fans in your life and mark your calendars.

      <title>Who's the Big Me?</title>
      <description>Hello hello!

On today’s show: the Met Gala guest list turned out to be… kind of second-rate, actually? Plus, a comprehensive explainer on what the hell went down between Drake and Kendrick Lamar this week, the influencers are truly influencing when it comes to baby names, two Home and Away stars have taken their on-screen romance off-screen too, Tom Brady’s been roasted and Madonna’s been swamped by… 1.6 million people.

This week, Mich recommended watching Colin from Accounts on Binge. Zara recommended reading Prima Facie by Suzie Miller.

This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to SIX the Musical for making this episode possible. Save the date for August 2nd, because there’s an exclusive Shameless event happening - ‘A Night with Shameless at SIX’ - and you’re invited. Tickets are live now! Head here to grab some for you and your friends.

      <description>Hi hi hiiii!
On today’s show: Sophia Bush has penned one of the most honest essays we’ve seen from a celebrity in a very long time. Plus, Nicole Kidman becomes the first Australian to win one of Hollywood’s most prestigious awards, Call Her Daddy’s Alex Cooper just threw one of the bougier weddings we can remember, and it turns out Jennifer Garner is dating a burger guy? And has been for six years? Then, Slow News Week lol.
This week, Zara recommended reading The Nightingale by Kristen Hannah. Mich recommended this NYT tomato soup recipe. To read Lauren Bensted’s piece in the Guardian called ‘I felt myself split into before and after’, head here.
Big thanks to our friends at South Australia for making this episode possible. Head to southaustralia.com to start planning your dream winter getaway today.

      <itunes:summary>Hi hi hiiii!
On today’s show: Sophia Bush has penned one of the most honest essays we’ve seen from a celebrity in a very long time. Plus, Nicole Kidman becomes the first Australian to win one of Hollywood’s most prestigious awards, Call Her Daddy’s Alex Cooper just threw one of the bougier weddings we can remember, and it turns out Jennifer Garner is dating a burger guy? And has been for six years? Then, Slow News Week lol.
This week, Zara recommended reading The Nightingale by Kristen Hannah. Mich recommended this NYT tomato soup recipe. To read Lauren Bensted’s piece in the Guardian called ‘I felt myself split into before and after’, head here.
Big thanks to our friends at South Australia for making this episode possible. Head to southaustralia.com to start planning your dream winter getaway today.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Harry and Meghan: Part one</title>
      <description>Good morning, friends!

As far as scandals go, there aren’t many bigger than Harry and Meghan’s dramatic estrangement from the British royal family. So, how did we get here? And who was really at fault for one of the great family fracturings of our time? 

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <description>Helloooo, friends!
On today’s show: the curious timing of Isla Fisher and Sacha Baron Cohen’s divorce, JoJo Siwa’s rebrand has made everyone mad, Billie Eilish wants you to be her close friend, Andrew Garfield has a hot normie girlfriend, the YouTuber who announced her baby’s arrival on the same day the media learned she’d filed for divorce, and there’s a chance the bizarre news stories you’ve read in the last month are the work of a comedian taking the piss.
This week, Zara recommended Scoop on Netflix. Mich recommended an article in The New Yorker called ‘A Woman In Earnest’ written by Tina Brown.
This episode was made possible by Dan’s Daily. Head to dansdaily.com.au now to discover the inside word on drinks.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Vanessa, Zac and High School Musical mania: Part two </title>
      <description>Well hello! 

To nineties babies, there are few celebrity couples more iconic than Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron. To us, they were Troy and Gabriella: total teen dreams. Only, their lives as young celebrities showed how ruthless the tabloid media could be. 

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Ruby Hall.

Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. CeraVe’s Advanced Repair Balm immediately hydrates, soothes and protects any dry, rough or compromised areas by forming a protective layer on your skin to help accelerate the skin’s natural repair process. Have healthy-looking skin all year round and shop CeraVe’s NEW Advanced Repair Balm, available in two sizes, exclusive at Chemist Warehouse nationwide.

      <description>Hiiii!
On today’s show: Kate Middleton shared her cancer diagnosis, and what is there to learn from all of this? Plus, Euphoria season three might… actually not happen, why the documentary ‘Quiet on Set’ is all over your social media feeds, Rebel Wilson’s memoir is about to be out in the world and all eyes are on Chapter 23 (and Sacha Baron Cohen), and Gwyneth Paltrow has announced a war on dill.
This week, Zara recommended the 'Who Trolled Amber' podcast. Mich recommended American Nightmare on Netflix, and Anne Hathaway's Vanity Fair profile.
This episode was made possible by the legends at Betty's Burgers. Experience their new limited edition Crispy Chicken Panko Yuzu burger this Easter.
This episode was audio produced by Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald (miss u, Nanabot Lee).

      <title>Winona and the CCTV footage </title>
      <description>Hiiii guys! 

Winona Ryder was one of the biggest celebrities in the world - an Academy Award-winning actress who’d risen to the very top of her industry. CCTV footage of her shoplifting from a major department store would send everything crashing down. 

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Warner Brothers for making this episode possible. Challengers is the sexy drama that everyone’s talking about and it’s definitely not one you’d want to miss.. It’s about passion, friendship and what happens when your past comes back to challenge you. Challengers is in cinemas from April 18, tickets are available from Tuesday the 26th!

      <title>Halle Berry's hit and run (and the rest of it)</title>
      <description>Hello, friends!

Halle Berry had ascended to the top of the Hollywood tree. She was on stage at the Oscars, gold trophy in hand, accepting the award for Best Actress. Just 10 days later, her marriage would crumble in front of the world.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

Big thanks to Pureology for making this episode possible. If you want hydrated, healthy hair, this is a PSA for you! To try Pureology’s Hydrate collection, you can shop it online via Adore Beauty, or in your local Pureology salon.

      <description>Oh hey, honeys!
On today’s show: well well well, if we weren’t Kate Middleton conspiracy theorists last week, we just might be after the developments over the weekend. Also! Our main takeaways from the Oscars, Ariana Grande’s new album sparks speculation that she was cheated on, Natalie Portman has quietly divorced Benjamin Millipied, and cue the wedding bells because Rupert Murdoch is ready to start the second half of his life! Again!
This week, Annabelle recommended going to see the musical Wicked and listening to Celine Song and Sofia Coppola on The A24 Podcast. Mich recommended Ira von Fürstenberg’s obituary in The New York Times.

      <title>A busty crustacean</title>
      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: SO MUCH STUFF. Including the rumours that Miley Cyrus’s mum married her little sister’s ex-boyfriend, why are there thoughts and prayers for Hailey and Justin Bieber?, What the hell is going on with the British royal family? Spice Girl Geri Halliwell’s marriage is in the tabloids for uncomfy reasons, the Guardian’s blistering piece about guru to the stars, Jay Shetty, AND Glasgow’s Willy Wonka Experience has social media in a stranglehold. 
To read ‘Uncovering the higher truth of Jay Shetty’, head here.
This week, Zara recommended Anyone But You. Mich recommended this MECCA MAX lipstick in the shade ‘Mean Girl’.

      <description>G’day, everybody!
On today’s show: why is traditional homemaking and womanhood a la Nara Smith so popular on TikTok? Olivia Rodrigo launches her Guts World tour, television personality Wendy Williams has been put in the spotlight of a highly controversial four-part documentary series, Zendaya wants to talk about Tom Holland, Aussie Margaret Zhang has been moved on from the top gig at VOGUE China, and did Taylor Swift’s dad punch a pap? Then! It’s Zara’s turn to play slow news week.
This week, Zara recommended Acquired’s podcast episode on Hermès. Mich recommended Ambika Mod on Radio 1’s Screen Time.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Mejuri for making this episode possible. The GANNI x Mejuri limited edition collection is available for purchase in North America and Australia now! Head online and get shopping.

      <title>Mich on career, books and trends</title>
      <description>It’s us! Dropping in your podcast feeds on a Saturday!
Why? Well, on Thursday we launched a very exciting podcast series over on The Shameless Book Club: it’s called The Tastemakers, and it’s something we’re so excited for you guys to listen to.
On The Tastemakers, friend of Shameless Media Gemma Dimond sits down with some of the biggest names in Australia’s fashion, food and media scenes to hear all about how they indulge: how they dress, eat, live and… read.
We’ve already dropped episode one with a very familiar face in The Shameless Book Club podcast feed, but we thought, why not give you a little taste, too? So! Here’s episode one of The Tastemakers with Gemma Dimond and Michelle Andrews…
Big thanks to Baileys Irish Cream Liqueur for making this episode possible. If you are over 18 and looking for a treat, head online or instore to your liquor retailer and shop Baileys. To explore a selection of delicious Baileys recipes, head here. (Remember to Drink Responsibly.)
This episode was audio produced by Chelsea Srinivasan.
In your ears today were host Gemma Dimond (@gemdimond) and guest Michelle Andrews (@michelleandrews1).
Join us in the all the book chat over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub, and our TikTok, 
@theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
If you want to make Mich’s favourite drink - Baileys on Ice - grab a short glass, add a few ice cubes and 50ml of Baileys Irish Cream. Enjoy!</description>

      <title>Not our strongest finish, sorry</title>
      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: it was the week that millions of people around the world fell in love with TikTokker @reesateesa, and for very good reason. Plus! Tom Sandoval’s New York Times profile is… a complete disaster, Dakota Johnson’s new movie has officially reached “so bad it’s good” status, while J Lo’s new film is, well, something we need to unpack together. And! Apparently, Khloe Kardashian has been spending her days Facetuning her cat and we have reason to believe Harry and Meghan’s wedding was… a bit smelly.
This week, Zara recommended reading ‘100 Small Acts of Love’ from The New York Times. Mich recommended Crime Scene on This American Life, as well as The Weekly Fifty.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Betty’s Burgers for making this episode possible. Grab your bestie and head to Betty’s Burgers on Thursday, the 29th of February to celebrate the extra day of Summer this year with free extras. Head to their socials to stay updated!

      <title>Old ginger bollocks</title>
      <description>G’day, everyone!
On today’s show: Allllll things Super Bowl, from the two moments that gave us the ick, to Usher’s halftime show, and the Ben Affleck ad that won us over. Then! Edward Enninful went bang with his final cover of British Vogue, Beyonce’s big announcement, Kim Kardashian’s new boyfriend, and a new development in one of the weirdest stories we covered last year. 
To watch that Dunkin’ Donuts ad we mentioned in today’s episode, head here.
This week, Zara recommended listening to Ben Winston on Awards Chatter, as well as One Day on Netflix. Mich recommended watching Nemesis on ABC.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Dan’s Daily for making this episode possible. Head online to Dan’s Daily today to up your cocktail game, expand your wine knowledge, or discover what’s trending in the world of drinks.
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘follow’ on Apple and Spotify. (Bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too!)

      <title>The Taylor Swift series: Part 4</title>
      <description>Happy Mondaaayyyy!
She’s the biggest name of our generation; a name synonymous with talent, power and, well, headlines. Taylor Swift is celebrity. So, let’s walk through everything that’s happened since we last covered her life.
This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. Head online at Adore Beauty and in-store or online at Chemist Warehouse today.

      <title>The Taylor Swift series: Parts 1-3</title>
      <description>Omg it’s us! In your podcast feeds! On a Saturday!
Why? Well! You might remember that, at the beginning of 2022, we did a three-part Scandal series exploring how Taylor Swift rose, fell, then rose again. Those three episodes are Shameless Media’s most downloaded episodes of all time. 
As you’re already very much aware: a LOT has happened in the Taylor Swift omniverse since we released that three-part series. So much that it… completely justifies… a couple more episodes.
So! To celebrate Taylor coming to Australia for the Eras Tour this week, we’re taking our most-popular series ever two steps further: to kick everything off we’ve repackaged our three existing episodes into one bumper podcast for you. Have a trip down memory lane with us here, then enjoy Part Four on Monday and Part Five the week after.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Totes $120! Mugs $125!</title>
      <description>Hey, fam!
On today’s show: Taylor Swift announced her brand new album at the Grammy’s and where does the woman get the time? And then, obviously, we need to talk about expensive mugs and overpriced totes. Plus, Nick Lachey brings back music Mondays (much to my delight!) and Michael Buble is a silly, goofy, very high man.
This week, Mich recommended ‘10 things I wish I’d known before deciding not to have kids at 45’ by Farrah Storr. Zara recommended Drunk Elephant’s Tiffany Masterson on How I Built This.
Big thanks to Betty’s Burgers for making this episode possible. Their Date Night Sorted Special is such a great offer - especially with Valentine’s Day coming up - and is available all of February exclusively in the Betty’s Burgers App, available to enjoy in restaurant or to takeaway.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee, Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald.

      <title>Who is Kylie Jenner? Part three</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, fam!
Welcome to the third and final part of our series on Kylie Jenner - one of the most famous people in the world. We’ve had an unprecedented level of access to her childhood and her life. But who is she, really? Well, that question is… tricky to answer.
This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Mejuri for making this episode possible. Head online and start your stack with Mejuri’s staple hoops.
We'd love your feedback! We wanna know a little bit more about how you engage with us so we can keep creating the content you crave. To be part of our exclusive Shameless Media Market Research Panel, head here to fill out our quick five-minute survey.

      <description>Hey, friends!
On today’s show: untangling what in the world is going on between Nicki Minaj and Megan Thee Stallion is a task, but we’re here to do it. Plus, Sofia Richie Grainge is pregnant, Travis Kelce is in the Super Bowl and all anyone wants to know is if Taylor Swift can get there, and then, our first Slow News Week of 2024.
This week, Mich recommended you stream Dance You Outta My Head by Cat Janice. Zara recommended Emily Blunt on the Awards Chatter podcast.

      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: Jacob Elordi is IT right now. And those rampant rumours that he’s fresh out of a breakup? Yeah, they were… completely wrong. Kim Kardashian’s office tour was completely unhinged, aaaaand How I Met Your Mother’s Josh Radnor got married and you could say it couldn’t have gone worse. AND THEN. Mich comes to the table with a ‘My Two Cents’: a viral article with the headline “You don’t need to document everything” is doing the rounds this week, and she has thoughts.
This week, Mich recommended World of Secrets: The Disciples from the BBC. Zara recommended Greta Gerwig on Desert Island Discs and Cheeky Run Club.

      <description>We’re baaaaack!
On today’s show: everything that happened over the summer break! From Ariana Grande telling us it’s not our business whose dick she rides, to host Jo Koy bombing at the Golden Globes, the Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift gossip session that was watched by the world, the viral trend that suggested Paul Mescal… runs away from his one-night stands, a brand new relationship between star of the moment, Barry Keoghan, and Sabrina Carpenter, convicted killer Gypsy Rose Blanchard becomes social media’s hottest new influencer, and an explainer on the Real Housewives finale that everyone’s been talking about.
This week Zara recommended All That’s Left Unsaid by Tracey Lien, ‘How to Discover Your Own Taste’ on the Ezra Klein Show, and Past Lives. Mich recommended The Villa by Rachel Hawkins, Boy Swallows Universe on Netflix, and Emerald Fennell’s interview on Vanity Fair’s podcast, Little Gold Men.

On today’s show: everything that happened over the summer break! From Ariana Grande telling us it’s not our business whose dick she rides, to host Jo Koy bombing at the Golden Globes, the Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift gossip session that was watched by the world, the viral trend that suggested Paul Mescal… runs away from his one-night stands, a brand new relationship between star of the moment, Barry Keoghan, and Sabrina Carpenter, convicted killer Gypsy Rose Blanchard becomes social media’s hottest new influencer, and an explainer on the Real Housewives finale that everyone’s been talking about.
This week Zara recommended All That’s Left Unsaid by Tracey Lien, ‘How to Discover Your Own Taste’ on the Ezra Klein Show, and Past Lives. Mich recommended The Villa by Rachel Hawkins, Boy Swallows Universe on Netflix, and Emerald Fennell’s interview on Vanity Fair’s podcast, Little Gold Men.

      <title>The 2023 SEOYAs</title>
      <description>Welcome to the 2023 Shameless End of Year Awards!!!!
As you guys know, the SEOYAs acknowledge the celebrity and pop culture stories that shaped the year. We’ve had a brains trust of 1000 Shameless listeners vote on who they think should win each category.
It’s a special episode and a special setup, because this is actually our first-ever full video episode. As we teased last week, we’re in a different studio today – we’re also drinking some cocktails, thanks to our mates at Dan Murphy’s – and we’d love for you to watch along. You can do exactly that by searching for ‘ShameMore’ on Spotify; it’s our subscription feed, but you don’t need a Shamemore subscription to watch this… it’s entirely free for everyone.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Dan’s Daily for making this very special episode possible. Head to dansdaily.com.au now and get all your inspo for this summer.
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘follow’ on Apple and Spotify. (Bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too!) 
Still not enough? Well! Our hearts! See below for everything else.

      <description>G’day, friends!
On today’s show: Taylor Swift is named TIME’s Person of the Year and takes a shot at Kim Kardashian in the process. There’s a royal photoshop fail in Will and Kate’s family Christmas card, Selena Gomez is in a relationship and letting loose in the comments section, Molly-Mae Hague says she’s “going through it”, and Hugh Grant is kinda grumpy but needs money, okay?
This week, Zara recommended watching the Actors on Actors interviews with Variety. They’re all amazing! Mich recommended ‘Revealed: Ben Roberts Smith - Truth on Trial’ on Stan, and ‘How French Is Timothée Chalamet’ in the New York Times.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Meshki for making this episode possible. Don’t forget that you can enjoy 15% off using the code ‘SHAMELESS15’.

      <title>… Fleabag?</title>
      <description>Why hello, everyone!
On today’s show: remember the ‘wedding of the century’ that we spoke about last week? Yeah, well… it turns out the groom could be looking at decades behind bars. Plus! Publicist Tree Paine has taken a big old whack at professional celebrity gossiper DeuxMoi, Billie Eilish has called out Variety for ‘outing her’, and friend of the show Dave Galafassi is BACK!!! Then we’re doing a slow news week!
This week, Zara recommended reading ‘How millennials learned to dread motherhood’ in Vox. Mich recommended reading a piece in the ABC called ‘Agatha Christie was the most famous detective novelist in the world. Then she found herself at the centre of a mystery’.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Dan’s Daily for making this episode possible. Head to dansdaily.com.au now to uncover the next big thing in drinks today.

      <itunes:summary>Why hello, everyone!
On today’s show: remember the ‘wedding of the century’ that we spoke about last week? Yeah, well… it turns out the groom could be looking at decades behind bars. Plus! Publicist Tree Paine has taken a big old whack at professional celebrity gossiper DeuxMoi, Billie Eilish has called out Variety for ‘outing her’, and friend of the show Dave Galafassi is BACK!!! Then we’re doing a slow news week!
This week, Zara recommended reading ‘How millennials learned to dread motherhood’ in Vox. Mich recommended reading a piece in the ABC called ‘Agatha Christie was the most famous detective novelist in the world. Then she found herself at the centre of a mystery’.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Dan’s Daily for making this episode possible. Head to dansdaily.com.au now to uncover the next big thing in drinks today.
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘follow’ on Apple and Spotify. (Bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too!)

      <description>Hellooooo, everybody!
On today’s show: videos of Tommy Fury partying it up with Chris Brown in Dubai are making us feel… a lot of things. The wedding of the century is here and the TikToks are something else, the main takeaways from Kylie Jenner’s interview with Jennifer Lawrence, Diddy has been accused of sexual assault by two more women, and the British podcast that unwittingly cancelled the impending wedding of a major influencer.
This week, Zara recommended reading ‘Happily Ever Divorced’ in The Cut. Mich recommended listening to the audiobook version of Green Dot by Madeleine Gray.

      <title>Just... Justin Timberlake: Part three</title>
      <description>Hey, legends! 
Welcome to the third and final part of our series on Justin Timberlake. Just saying his name is enough to elicit a reaction. For some, he’s the hitmaker who turned boy band adoration into pop superstardom. For others, he’s the prime example of everything to dislike in a celebrity.
This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Lo Bros for making this episode possible. To try the Lo Bros Purple Grape Kombucha, head to selected Coles supermarkets or independent grocery stores to purchase.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

      <description>G’day, everyone!
On today’s show: From the curious marketing campaign behind Anyone But You and The Curse, Suki Waterhouse announced she’s pregnant mid-performance, rapper Cassie accuses Diddy of sexual assault and abuse, reviews of The Crown season six are in and they are… emphatically negative, Travis Kelce has been profiled by the Wall Street Journal, and Kanye West’s Australian wife Bianca Censori might now be his ex.
This week, Zara recommended this piece in the New York Times about the recent shut down of the site, Jezebel. Mich recommended the Robbie Williams documentary on Netflix.

      <title>Craving a pure, raw electric guitar</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone!
On today’s show: 1989 Taylor’s Version is here, but a Harry Styles cameo is not. The world mourns the death of FRIENDS star, Matthew Perry, there are whispers in DeuxMoi that another celebrity divorce is brewing, Kylie Jenner has launched Khy and it’s, well, kind of genius. And then: how the hell did Martin Scorcese become TikTok’s new… it boy?
This week, Zara recommended Green Dot by Madeline Gray. Mich recommended listening to Britney’s memoir on audiobook, as well as watching Last Stop Larrimah on Netflix.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Roadshow and their new release ‘The Hunger Games - The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes’ for making this episode possible. ‘The Hunger Games - The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes’ is in cinemas from November 16th, so head to cinemas and experience it on the big screen.

      <title>The PFPE</title>
      <description>Hellooooo, everyone!
On today’s show: Britney Spears’s memoir is finally out in the world, so what are the key takeaways from one of the most anticipated books of the last year? Plus, Sophia Bush has reportedly moved on with a former soccer star and, well, where do we start with the drama around that story? Then, Rebecca Loos isn’t happy with David Beckham’s documentary and Meryl Streep’s marriage also falls victim to 2023.
This week, Mich recommended the docu-series ‘Coleen Rooney: The Real Wagatha Story’ on Disney Plus. Zara recommended reading Demon Copperhead, and also… ham! This Gordon Ramsay recipe is Zara’s go-to.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Pureology for making this episode possible. If you want to try Pureology’s Strength Cure collection, you can shop it online via Adore Beauty, or in your local Pureology salon.

      <title>The many iterations of Ariana Grande: Part three</title>
      <description>Hello, everybody!
Welcome to the third and final part of our series on Ariana Grande. She was the superstar who navigated a terrorist attack and the death of a former partner within 18 months.

This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Hidden nuances, subtle beauties, etc!</title>
      <description>G’day, friends!
On today’s show: Well, we simply must talk about Will and Jada and the news that... actually… they’ve not been together since 2016. Plus, the questions we have after Kendall Jenner took a sizeable paycheck from Mark Zuckerberg, why on earth have Sophie Turner and Priyanka Chopra Jonas unfollowed each other, and then, Julia Fox’s very candid memoir. Oh, and you bet we’re bringing back by popular demand SLOW NEWS WEEK, which is a win for podcast segment inventors everywhere.
This week, Mich recommended our book club pick for this month, None of This is True by Lisa Jewell, as well as the podcast Big Small Talk. Zara recommended ‘My Delirious Trip to the Heart of Swiftiedom’ from The New York Times Magazine.
As you’ll have heard, our new book, 4am, is out in the world this week! You can grab yourself a copy on Booktopia, Amazon, or purchase the audiobook via Audible.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to CeraVe’s Blemish Control range for making this episode possible. You can shop CeraVe’s entire Blemish Control range now at Chemist Warehouse nationwide.

Welcome to part two of our series on Ariana Grande. A gig on Broadway, a Nickelodeon show, and a voice so powerful it was considered once in a generation: Ariana Grande was on the path to superstardom. But 2017 would show the singer just how awful - how heartbreaking - fame can be.

      <title>A wee mea culpa</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone!
On today’s show: the Beckham documentary has been released and we have oh so many thoughts, it appears that Gigi Hadid and Bradley Cooper are Hollywood’s newest couple, Emma Chamberlain is single, all of social media is theorising that Andy Cohen and John Mayer are more than friends, Olivia Wilde’s Instagram activity is under the microscope, and then finally: why did TikTok’s It Girl Matilda Djerf deactivate her account this week? 
Ahead of the referendum this weekend, Zara recommended watching Briggs’s video ‘Far Enough - Vote Yes’. She also recommended ‘Sold Out? Gab Waller Can Help’ in Vanity Fair. Mich recommended Quarterback on Netflix.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Dan’s Daily for making this episode possible. Head to dansdaily.com.au now to uncover the next big thing in drinks today.

      <title>David and Victoria Beckham: A special from the archives</title>
      <description>SURPRISE! We’re so excited to be bringing you this special, jam-packed episode from the archives.
As you've probably noticed, the Beckham documentary has just dropped on Netflix and is going absolutely wild right now. We binged it, and at the end of the docu-series thought: you know what? We did our own three-part series on David and Victoria Beckham's marriage years ago. It's one of our favorite scandal series of all time and has a lot of information about the celebrity side of David and Victoria Beckham that might not have been covered in the documentary series. We have lots of new listeners who may have missed this series back in the day, so to those listeners: this is our David and Victoria Beckham scandal series from a couple of years back. We’ve packed three episodes into one and we hope you enjoy it!
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Girl summer? Willy nilly winter!</title>
      <description>Hiya, friends!
On today’s show: *that* Kim and Kourtney Kardashian phone call and what we make of the speculation that Travis Barker is actually at the heart of it all. Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis quietly bury the hatchet, an episode of Dax Shepard’s podcast attracted some ugly headlines, we need to talk about the rise of the “girl’s girl”, and then, Zara’s got a brand new segment!!!
This week, Mich recommended ‘Who Killed Jill Dando?’ on Netflix. Zara recommended this interview with Rhodri Giggs.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <description>Hello, pals!
Today we are joined by Youtuber turned entrepreneur Grace Beverley. For the unacquainted, Grace is a force to be reckoned with. Grace blew up when she was studying at Oxford and decided to document her life with vlogs on YouTube. From there, she channeled her incredibly engaged audience into not one, but two, business ventures: a sustainable activewear brand called TALA and a fitness company called Shreddy. In this chat, Grace talks about finding insane levels of success at such a young age, the blessing and curse that comes with social media fame, and shares something she’s actually never talked about before: her ADHD diagnosis.
This episode was audio produced by Michelle Andrews and Annabelle Lee.

      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: Sophie Turner sues Joe Jonas and shows him what magnificent PR looks like, Taylor Swift wants you to know who Travis Kelce is, Emma Roberts has been accused of transphobia by a former costar, and we absolutely need to talk about the Netflix romcom that we watched and absolutely adored this week.
Zara recommended Imogen Heap’s newsletter article, ‘A Day With Taylor’, and ‘Say It To My Face’ from This American Life. Mich recommended Pandora Sykes’s interview with her friend, ghostwriter Katherine Ormerod.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss: a Sentimental Garbage crossover</title>
      <description>Hiya, friends!
Today, Mich and Caroline (and producer Annabelle!) turn their attention to something you’ve all been *demanding* from us: a deep dive into Taylor Swift and Karlie Kloss, and what the hell happened to their friendship. You guys know that commentary around Taylor and Karlie has run rampant for years, so while we won’t get too deeply in the weeds of every single internet hole, consider this episode a wide-ranging pop culture exploration… what is the commentary about Taylor and Karlie? What are the three main theories, and why can’t people stop talking about them? And what does their friendship maybe say… about… us?
Head here to check out Caroline’s Australia tour dates, and here to pick up a copy of her latest book, ‘The Rachel Incident’.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee and Chelsea Srinivasan.
Big thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode possible. If you want to elevate your activewear head to eliteelevensporting.com or download the Elite Eleven app and shop today.

      <title>Tinkerbell’s dad</title>
      <description>G’day, mates!
On today’s show: Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness’s marriage is over and the world (well, mostly our mothers) is mourning, Russell Brand says the mainstream media is out to get him after he is accused of multiple sexual assaults, and who and what is a Tube Girl? Plus, no - Paul Mescal is not Daisy Edgar Jones’s new boyfriend, Drew Barrymore faces backlash for returning to work and are the men OK? Why do they think about The Roman Empire so much? 
This week, Zara recommended ‘The Pandemic Skip’ by Katy Schneider in The Cut. Mich recommended ‘The Ozempic Era of Weight Loss’ on The Daily.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Dan Murphy’s Decoded Wine Awards 2023 for making this episode possible. If you want to try one of the award-winning wines, head in-store or online to Dan Murphy’s and shop.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Dolly Alderton</title>
      <description>Why hello, everyone!
Today, we are joined by one of the UK’s most prominent authors, Dolly Alderton. Some of you might be thinking, but wait! You guys have already interviewed Dolly! And you’d be right. Back in 2020, in the depths of lockdown, we spoke to Dolly over Zoom about her life and career. But, given how much we adore her, and given how she was so highly requested by you guys, we thought: why not make her the first person to ever return to Shameless In Conversation? But this is an In Conversation episode with a twist: Of course, Mich asked Dolly about what life has been like in the three years since we last spoke, but given she’s the ultimate Agony Aunt (or sister), we also wanted to pick her brain on your big life dilemmas. We did a callout and asked you what you needed Dolly’s advice on, so today, we opened the Shameless Mailbag and put Dolly’s marvelous mind to work.
To pre-order Dolly’s new book, Good Material, head here.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Ashton, Mila, and their “role model” Danny</title>
      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: we have quite a few updates about the Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas divorce. Jimmy Fallon is the latest talk show host to be outed as a terrible boss, the video going viral after the VMAS, and finally: we do a massive deep dive on everything there is to know about Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis asking a judge for leniency after their friend was found guilty of raping two women.
This week, Zara recommended The End Credits by Patty Lin. Mich recommended Olivia Rodrigo’s sophomore album, Guts.
To read Eric Levitz’s piece in the Intelligencer that we mentioned in today’s episode, head here. 
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Steven Bartlett</title>
      <description>Hello! Welcome to the first episode of our very special In Conversation series.
Today on the show, we are joined by one of the most recognisable business and media personalities in Britain, Steven Bartlett. In 2014, he co-founded a social media marketing agency called Social Chain, which cemented the then-22-year-old as one of the leaders in the social media marketing world. Three years later, he created his podcast, The Diary of a CEO, which is one of the biggest podcasts in the UK right now. Two years ago, he was announced as the youngest-ever investor of BBC’s Dragon’s Den. All were achieved by the age of 31. In this chat, Steven talks about everything: from being expelled from school and dropping out of uni, his relationship with religion, the reason he never thought he’d end up in such a healthy romantic relationship, what it’s like coming into money, and why he never sets an alarm.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Big thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode possible. If you want to shop the range head to eliteelevensporting.com or download the Elite Eleven app today.

      <description>Hiya, pals!
On today’s show: what the hell happened in Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner’s marriage? We unpack the latest celebrity divorce announcement of 2023. Then! Olivia Rodrigo anxiously answers whether her new single is a jab at Taylor Swift, Kylie Jenner and Timothee Chalamet make their public debut as a couple, and we absolutely need to discuss how Justin Bieber’s sartorial choices became the fixation of TikTok this week.
This week, Mich recommended Good Material by Dolly Alderton. Annabelle recommended Troye Sivan on Dua Lipa: At Your Service.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee and Michelle Andrews.

      <title>Not the reverse Steven Bradbury</title>
      <description>G’day, everybody!
On today’s show: We’ve officially entered the era of the rebrand - from strawberry girl aesthetic to tomato girl fall, so what the hell is going on? It’s official: We single-handedly manifested a Stormzy and Maya Jama reunion, an update on what the hell is up with Scooter Braun, unpacking the viral controversy around *that* Che Diaz profile, and Pete Davidson is single again.
This week, Zara had two recommendations: this episode on Oprah from Acquired and The Intern on Netflix. Mich recommended the Skims Fits Everybody Bralette.
Big thanks to Swisse for making this episode possible. Check out the Swisse Sleep Range by heading online or to your local retailer. Always read the label and follow the directions for use.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee, Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald.

      <title>Scootin' away from Scooter</title>
      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: three of Scooter Braun’s biggest stars have all reportedly left him within the space of a week, so what the hell is going on? Plus, everything we know about Britney Spears and Sam Asghari’s ugly divorce, Jack Antonoff had a star-studded wedding to Margaret Qualley, people are very, very irritated by Disney’s live-action remake of Snow White and are taking its young star to task, and - finally! - what the hell happened between podcaster Bobbi Althoff and Drake?
This week, Mich recommended the Depp v. Heard documentary series on Netflix. Zara recommended the 'Person of the Week' podcast episode with Jack Antonoff.
Big thanks to Double for making this episode possible. They have been generous enough to give you guys 15% off your order with the code ‘SHAMELESS’ - head to double.online/shameless to shop. Plus, if you shop through the weekend you can enjoy a total discount of up to 30% off with Double's Afterpay Day Sale, available until the 27th of August.

      <title>Gwyneth, Goop, and everything else: Part three</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, everyone!
Welcome to the third and final part of our series on Gwyneth Paltrow. By 2008, Gwyneth Paltrow had conquered Hollywood. Her next frontier - her wellness company, goop - would prove more controversial, and indeed successful, than everything before it combined.
Big thanks to 20th Century Studios and ‘A Haunting in Venice’ for making this episode possible. To celebrate the release of the film we will be asking our community to share their very own whodunit stories for their chance to win tickets to a private screening here in Melbourne on the 14th of September. Keep your eyes peeled on our socials for a fun game called “Shamelessly Haunted.”
This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

        <![CDATA[<p>Happy Monday, everyone!</p><p>Welcome to the third and final part of our series on Gwyneth Paltrow. By 2008, Gwyneth Paltrow had conquered Hollywood. Her next frontier - her wellness company, goop - would prove more controversial, and indeed successful, than everything before it combined.</p><p>Big thanks to <a href="https://www.20thcenturystudios.com.au/movies/a-haunting-in-venice">20th Century Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.20thcenturystudios.com.au/movies/a-haunting-in-venice">‘A Haunting in Venice’</a> for making this episode possible. To celebrate the release of the film we will be asking our community to share their very own whodunit stories for their chance to win tickets to a private screening here in Melbourne on the 14th of September. Keep your eyes peeled on our socials for a fun game called “Shamelessly Haunted.”</p><p>This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.</p><p>Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share?

      <description>G’day, everyone!
On today’s show: Karlie Kloss made a curious appearance in the nosebleeds section of the Eras Tour, adding another chapter to the world’s most cryptic celebrity feud. The team that works at an American magazine has had a headline nightmare, it seems all of TikTok is mourning the death of Anna Paul’s relationship, Aussie label Zimmermann sells for a billion dollars and what the hell do we make of Lil Tay’s supposed “Instagram hacking” scandal?
This week, Zara recommended The Sex Lives of College Girls on Binge. Mich recommended The Matildas docuseries on Disney+. And don’t forget to check out our latest Stranger Than Fiction episode, ‘The author who faked her own death’, over on our The Shameless Book Club feed.
Big thanks to Mejuri for making this episode possible.  Head to the Mejuri website now to purchase your next piece of jewellery.

      <title>The curse continues</title>
      <description>Hellooo, everyone!
On today’s show: Lizzo, Lizzo, Lizzo. The Grammy-award-winning pop star has been accused of some rather dodgy behaviour in a lawsuit from three of her former employees. Then! How did Sophia Bush go from gushing about her husband in June, to filing for divorce in August? Bella Hadid addresses the rumours she’s been in rehab, Natalie Portman is probably single again, and the arts and craft section of TikTok is at war and Mich cannot look away.
This week, Zara recommended this piece about gatekeeping in The Cut, and the new Thank God You’re Here. Mich recommended Chrissy and John’s house tour with Architectural Digest, as well as the latest season of The Real Housewives of New York City.
For that link to Marty Singer’s profile in Vanity Fair, head here.
Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. You can shop the range at Chemist Warehouse, Priceline, Terry White or Adore Beauty, nationwide.

      <title>Ummm, where do we begin?</title>
      <description>Oh, you bet we’re back. 
On today’s show: Well, just about everything. While we were gone two celebrity couples filed for divorce and another broke off their engagement, Jonah Hill’s ex-girlfriend leaked his texts and accused him of being a narcissist, childhood best friends Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods repaired their four-year rift, Twitter became ‘X’ and gained a new competitor ‘Threads’, Doja Cat offended half a million people, and TikTok’s IT Girl got sprung kissing a teenager. YEP.
This week, Zara recommended Homegoing, Between You and Me and Love Marriage. Mich recommended The Guest, The Soulmate and that you see Barbie, of course. 
Big thanks to the Swisse Sleep Range for making this episode possible. Go the Swisse to sleep! Swap the scrolling for sleeping and while you're at it check out the Swisse Sleep Range. Find out more here. 
This episode was audio produced by Michelle Andrews, Zara McDonald and Sohani Goonetillake.

      <title>Ashton and Demi: Part three</title>
      <description>Hello hello!
Welcome to the third and final part of our series on Demi and Ashton. For a time, the tabloids could not stop talking about Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher’s 15-year age gap. Eventually, though, they were distracted by something much juicier: Ashton’s alleged infidelity.
Big thanks to the musical Wicked for making this episode possible. To watch the ‘musical with brains, heart and courage’ as described by TIME Magazine then head to WickedtheMusical.com.au to book your tickets.
This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘subscribe’ on Apple (bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too) or ‘follow’ on Spotify.

      <title>Ashton and Demi: Part two</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, everyone!
Welcome to part two of our series on Ashton and Demi. Demi Moore and Bruce Willis ruled the late 80s and 90s, but eventually, their marriage crumbled. It was the man Demi married next - a boyish, rambunctious prankster named Ashton Kutcher - that would have the whole world talking.
Big thanks to Pureology’s Color Fanatic Multi-Tasking Leave-In Spray for making this episode possible. If you want to add this spray to your routine you can find it in your local Pureology Salon, or online via Adore Beauty.
This episode was researched by Eilish Gilligan and audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>Chad and Sophia's five-month marriage</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, friends!
They were the young and beautiful actors that ruled the mid-noughties on One Tree Hill. But the calamitous end to Sophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray’s marriage would have people asking questions for years to come.

      <title>Everybody has a Taylor ticket story</title>
      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: The Barbie marketing campaign is well and truly amping up and it’s all we can talk about in the Shameless Media office, why is Blake Lively facing backlash over the release of her new Betty Booze cocktails, what’s going on with all these rumours Kyle Richards and her marriage and then, we unpack the most perfectly timed mailbag: is it OK to not want to sell Taylor Swift tickets to someone you don’t deem a big enough fan? 
This week, Annabelle recommended watching Swarm on Amazon Prime. Zara recommended listening to the Jonas Brothers on Armchair Expert.
Big thanks to Roadshow and the newly released comedy Joyride for making this episode possible. If Joyride has piqued your interest, grab some popcorn and head to your local cinema now.
This episode was audio produced by Annabelle Lee.

      <title>A sushi scandal</title>
      <description>Update: In an earlier version of this episode, Mich accidentally said “Olivia” instead of Sophia Culpo. That error has been amended.

Hello, legends!
On today’s show: Is Jennifer Lawrence’s new movie as problematic as some people are saying it is? Molly-Mae steps down from a role that many found controversial to begin with, how the Glastonbury crowd had Lewis Capaldi’s back and Alix Earle’s soft-launching her new boyfriend has kicked off quite the TikTok controversy.
This week, Mich recommended Amelia Dimoldenberg on Louis Theroux’s podcast. Zara recommended ‘Why Sarah Jessica Parker Keeps Playing Carrie Bradshaw’ by Rachel Syme in the New Yorker.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Really Good, Actually</title>

Hello, book clubbers!
This month, we read Monica Heisey’s debut novel: Really Good, Actually. The book is told through the eyes of Maggie - a 29-year-old whose marriage ended just 608 days after it started. Sure, she’s alone for the first time in her life, can’t afford her rent and her obscure PhD is going nowhere, but she’s reaaaally good. As Maggie throws herself headlong into the chaos of her first year of divorce, she finds herself questioning absolutely everything.
Big thanks to Audible for making this episode possible. Download the Audible app to browse their audiobooks, podcasts, and Audible Originals when you download the Audible app and start listening today.
Got some thoughts on our July pick, ‘Yellowface’ by R.F. Kuang? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>Grifters and daddies</title>
      <description>Hey hey!
On today’s show: Taylor Swift is coming to Australia, Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant and announced it in quite the creative way, and Harry and Meghan part ways with Spotify amid being called “grifters”. Plus, Kayla Itsines speaks of her split from her fiance and business partner Tobi Pearce, and then can we talk about Daddy’s Day?
This week, Mich recommended watching Shiny Happy People on Amazon Prime. Zara recommended reading Yellowface by R.F. Kuang and trying Birch &amp; Waite’s Parsley, Dill &amp; Tarragon Seafood sauce.
Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. You can pick up a bottle of the CeraVe Moisturising Lotion or a tub of their Moisturising Cream now at Chemist Warehouse, Priceline, Terry White, or Adore Beauty, nationwide.

      <description>Hellooo, everyone!
On today’s show: Mich watched The Idol so you don’t have to, so what does she actually think? Plus, Leo and Gigi seem to be back on again but the press is getting a little confused by it all, Amy Schumer has an issue with all those celebrities on Ozempic, another bizarre celebrity couple enters the cosmos, and then, Jennifer Coolidge’s advice for life.
Head here to purchase our charity merch! There aren’t many jumpers left so make sure you get in quick.
This week, Mich recommended Love &amp; Death on Binge. Zara recommended Amy Chozick on Longform and ‘What Good Personal Style Has in Common’ from Harling Ross Anton’s newsletter, Gumshoe.

      <title>Money screams!</title>
      <description>G’day, friends!
On today’s show: rumours are swirling that Natalie Portman’s husband had an affair with a 25-year-old climate activist, it looks like Taylor Swift and Matty Healy might be over almost as soon as they began, there’s been a colossal power struggle over at VOGUE, and the long-running Sex and the City feud has taken a weird turn.
This week, Zara recommended listening to Greta Gerwig on the podcast, Dua Lipa: At Your Service, as well as 'The New York Times Company’ from the podcast, Acquired. Mich recommended listening to the podcast, Mother’s Guilt.
Big thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode possible. Elite Eleven is giving away $50,000 (!!) to two people (!!!!). To be in the running, spend $50 in-store, online, or in the app between June 21st (so when the sale starts) to August 31st. During the sale period, our code ‘SHAMELESS10’ will be inactive but outside of those times, you are welcome to use it to get a cheeky 10 percent off.

      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: We finally have answers as to what caused the huge rift between This Morning’s Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. It’s almost time for Barbie Mania, Matty Healy has some… choice words… for anyone who was offended by those February podcast comments, and it’s that time of the year again: the top 100 Australian influencers have been named, and true to form, we have about 10,000 questions.
This week, Mich recommended listening to Edward Enninful being interviewed on The Diary of a CEO. Zara recommended following the 7th Heaven TikToker you’ve probably seen on your feeds, Rob Anderson.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Pineapple Street</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/1CtZYT73nntQsevXK6HoIv?si=f3e51848ccdb49d7

G’day, book clubbers!
This month, we read Jenny Jackson’s debut novel, Pineapple Street. Pineapple Street follows three women in an old money Brooklyn Heights family: one was born with money, one who married into it, and one who wants to give it all away. Over the course of the novel we learn about the intricacies of the Stockton family’s dynamic, how they each feel about their relationship with wealth, and whether or not you can ever really break out of a mold your parents created for you. 
Big thanks to Audible for making this episode possible. If you’re keen to check out audiobooks, podcasts and audible originals, download the Audible app and start listening today.
Got some thoughts on our June pick, ‘Really Good, Actually’ by Monica Heisey? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>That's one cursed couch</title>
      <description>Hey, legends!
On today’s show: Two of the UK’s most high-profile television personalities have had such a falling out, one of them has been turfed off the job. Dua Lipa has a new boyfriend and her ex Anwar Hadid doesn’t seem at all happy about it, Taylor Swift says she’s ‘never been happier’, and why is the internet obsessed with a big blue couch?
This week, Zara recommended this Nick Cannon profile in the LA Times and My Spectacular Betrayal in Modern Love. Mich recommended listening to Florence Pugh on Off Menu with Ed Gamble and James Acaster.
Big thanks to The Clearing, streaming only on Disney Plus, for making this episode possible. Head to www.disneyplus.com to watch The Clearing, a Star Original series, now streaming on Disney Plus.

      <title>Resting grumpy face :(</title>
      <description>G’day, friends!
On today’s show: Keith Urban accidentally hard-launched a long-rumoured celebrity couple, we might finally know what ended the friendship between Selena Gomez and Francia Raiza, the timeline of one Hollywood couple’s divorce is raising questions, and then! Mich comes to the table with My Two Cents: is there mounting pressure on Gen Z to live a life of luxury?
This week, Mich recommended Ed Sheeran’s docuseries The Sum of It All on Disney+ and season three of Couples Therapy. Zara recommended Shonda Rhimes on Armchair Expert and David Sedaris on Desert Island Discs.
Big thanks to VisitCanberra for making this episode possible. If you’re looking to plan a weekend away, head to visitcanberra.com.au/shameless for some itinerary inspo.

      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: What in the world is going on with Taylor Swift and Matty Healy? Plus, some fairly juicy Coronation drama, a small, personal petition regarding Daisy Edgar Jones and Andrew Garfield, and then, Ed Sheeran wins his copyright case and it’s wonderful because we love Ed Sheeran here at Shameless.
This week, Zara recommended Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story on Netflix and Nick Cave’s piece on why he’s attending the coronation. Mich recommended the profile ‘Liz Holmes wants you to forget about Elizabeth’ in The New York Times.

      <title>The prison of “never serving”</title>
      <description>G’day, friends!
On today’s show: The Met Gala of course! It’s our favourite time of year when Jason Derulo is falling down the stairs and the celebrities are doing their very best work on the red carpet. So, what did we make of the spectacle? Then, those Sydney Sweeney-Glen Powell cheating rumours just got more confusing, James Corden has officially said cya to late-night TV, and the “Aussie royal wedding” that hijacked the news cycle on the weekend.
This week, Mich recommended ‘Anna Wintour on Karl Lagerfeld, Kim Kardashian and those Bill Nighy rumours’ in The Telegraph. Zara recommended Free Food For Millionaires by Min Jin Lee, and ‘Not caring about your job: freedom or misery?’ in Haley Nahman’s newsletter Maybe Baby.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Vladimir</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7FN07LZkPnUfp7eXzQQWd5?si=dbfc7cb8957844c7

Happy Saturday, book clubbers!
This month, we read ‘Vladimir’ by Julia May Jonas. This novel is told from the perspective of a deliciously incisive narrator: a popular English professor whose husband, a charismatic teacher at the same small liberal arts college, is under investigation for his inappropriate relationships with his former students. The couple has long had a mutual understanding when it comes to their extramarital pursuits, but with these new allegations, life has become far less comfortable for them both. And when our narrator becomes increasingly infatuated with Vladimir, a celebrated, married young novelist who’s just arrived on campus, their tinder-box world comes dangerously close to exploding.

Go behind the scenes of the fast-growing, premium activewear brand with their two podcasts. Follow @eliteelevenpodcasts on Instagram for all the updates and subscribe to Not Our Business and Save Me A Seat on Spotify and Apple Podcasts today.
Got some thoughts on our May pick, ‘Pineapple Street’ by Jenny Jackson? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>The Great Unfollowing of Joe Alwyn</title>
      <description>Hey, legends!
On today’s show: Sofia Richie’s wedding has just cemented her as the “it girl” of 2023, what’s going on behind the Great Unfollowing of Joe Alwyn? Nadia Bartel sits down with Stellar Magazine to talk about the white powder controversy of 2021 for the first time, and the rom-com cheating rumours between Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell that have us in a chokehold.
This week, Zara recommended this Lucian Grainge profile in The Financial Times, as well as the LVMH episode on the podcast Acquire. Mich recommended watching Jury Duty on Amazon Prime.
Big thanks to Stan for making this episode possible. You can watch the brand new Stan Original Series Totally Completely Fine now, only on Stan. Start your 30-day free trial today.

      <title>The coronation, brought to you by American Idol</title>
      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: the celebrity festival of celebrity festivals, Coachella, is here, and there are two questions on everyone’s minds: are Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello back on, and what the hell happened to Frank Ocean’s headline set? Then! Meghan Markle won’t be at King Charles’s coronation, Lili Reinhart is trolling her ex Cole Sprouse, and sorry, Zara smells a rat with Matthew McConaughey’s new press tour.
This week, Zara recommended this obituary for crime writer Anne Perry, as well as the memoir ‘This Is Not a Pity’ by Abi Morgan. Mich recommended Chrissy Swan on The Imperfects and ‘When academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert met comedian Sami Shah’ in The Sydney Morning Herald.
Big thanks CeraVe and their new Blemish Control range, available exclusively at Chemist Warehouse, for making this episode possible.

      <title>Keeping up with the Hadids: Part two</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone!
Welcome to part two of our series on the Hadid family. By 2014 Gigi Hadid was THE ‘it girl’, Bella Hadid had started her own modeling career, and Yolanda Hadid was a Real Housewives star. But with a DUI, Munchausen’s allegations, and a high-profile divorce, all was not well in the Hadid family.
Big thanks to Disney+ and the special event ‘Til Death Do Us Part Kourtney and Travis’ for making this episode possible. Make sure you check out the special episode-only event of Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker's wedding - streaming now only on Disney+.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

      <title>It's 100% legit</title>
      <description>Hey, legends!
On today’s show: The Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn split headlines that are, we’re sad to say, completely legit. Then, are Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet dating? How Ellie Goulding became the face of fake news, who betrayed Mandy Moore, and we have reason to believe that last week’s story about Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher’s anti-nepo-babies was, well, bullshit.
This week, Zara recommended reading ‘Is Therapy-Speak Making Us Selfish?’ in Bustle and subscribing to Harling Ross Anton’s newsletter, Gumshoe. Mich recommended heading to your local cinema to watch Air.
Big thanks to Quay Australia and their new festival edit for making this episode possible. If you’re keen on a bold pair of sunnies, you can head to quayaustralia.com.au and browse their whole collection.

      <title>Thank God Our Petition Worked</title>
      <description>G’day, friends!
On today’s show: Two weeks after announcing his engagement to a woman named Ann Lesley Smith, Rupert Murdoch is back on the market ladies!!! Then, the reports about Em Rata’s ex-husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard, are nothing short of disgraceful, two local Love Island stars are in a public slinging match, and how Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are trying to raise a family of anti-nepo-babies.
This week, Zara recommended Alex Cooper on The Diary Of A CEO and ‘My Marriage Was Never the Same After That’ in The Cut. Mich recommended Anna Kendrick on Armchair Expert and ‘Clare Stephens: On Being Jealous Of Her Best Friend’ from the But Are You Happy? podcast.
Big thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode possible. Elite Eleven hopes to open many more stores across Australia in the coming months so stay tuned. In the meantime, use the code ‘SHAMELESS10’ in-store for 10 percent off storewide.

      <title>Naomi: Part two</title>
      <description>Hello, everybody!
Welcome to the second and final part of our series on Naomi Campbell. In February 2001, Naomi Campbell woke to find that her private battle with drugs and alcohol had been turned into front-page news by the British tabloids. Could she have ignored it? Possibly. But instead, Naomi decided to fight.
Big thanks to Pureology’s Hydrate Shampoo + Conditioner for making this episode possible. If you want to try Pureology’s Hydrate collection, you can shop it online via Adore Beauty, or in your local Pureology salon.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

Happy Saturday, book clubbers!
This month, we read ‘Alone With You in the Ether’ by Olivie Blake. The book follows our two main characters, Regan and Aldo, who meet by chance at the Art Institute. Prior to the meeting, he is a doctoral student who manages his destructive thoughts with compulsive calculations about time travel; she is a bipolar counterfeit artist, undergoing court-ordered psychotherapy. And then, well, they fall in love. But, like all good romance books, their love story is complicated, and we’re taken on the ride. 
Got some thoughts on our April pick, ‘Vladimir’ by Julia May Jones? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

As you’ll have heard in this episode, season three of ‘everybody has a secret’ has just launched and we’d love for you to check it out. Head here to listen to ‘the brother’ on Spotify, and here to find it on Apple.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <description>Hey, friends!
On today’s show: Oh, Gwyneth. The founder of Goop and lover of “rectal ozone therapy” has shared her diet on a wellness podcast and it sounds like a parody. Plus! Taylor Swift’s eras tour is here and it’s about as Taylor Swift as you can get, we’ve found the missing piece of the Law Roach retirement puzzle, and is Emma Chamberlain really charging $10,000 for an Instagram DM?
This week, Mich recommended reading ‘The Man of Your Dreams: For $300, Replika sells an AI companion who will never die, argue, or cheat — until his algorithm is updated’ in The Cut. Zara recommended ‘How to Run a Fashion Magazine in China in 2023’ in the New York Times.
For Lindsay Peoples’s interview with Law Roach, head here.

Taylor Swift’s eras tour is here and it’s about as Taylor Swift as you can get, we’ve found the missing piece of the Law Roach retirement puzzle, and is Emma Chamberlain really charging $10,000 for an Instagram DM?
This week, Mich recommended reading ‘The Man of Your Dreams: For $300, Replika sells an AI companion who will never die, argue, or cheat — until his algorithm is updated’ in The Cut. Zara recommended ‘How to Run a Fashion Magazine in China in 2023’ in the New York Times.
For Lindsay Peoples’s interview with Law Roach, head here.

      <title>The Hollywood Philanderers: Ralph Fiennes</title>
      <description>G’day, mates!
Welcome to the final installment of our series on Hollywood Philanderers. Today, we’re talking about Ralph Fiennes. He’s probably not the most front-of-mind celebrity in 2023, but the real-life stories behind the man who played Voldemort in Harry Potter or the love interest in Maid in Manhattan are almost better than fiction.
Big thanks to Hey Tiger Chocolate for making this episode possible. Hey Tiger Chocolate is available now in selected Independent retailers and online at HeyTiger.com.au.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

      <title>Hughmungously awkward (sorry)</title>
      <description>Hello, everybody!
On today’s show: The Oscars, of course! The champagne carpet was rolled out, history was made, and Hugh Grant was grumpy as can be. Plus! Cara Delevingne has spoken about substance abuse and sobriety, there are rumours the 2023 Met Gala could be Kardashian-free, and what happens when the kids of influencers grow up? Teen Vogue has the rather sobering answers.
This week, Zara recommended Suki Waterhouse on High Low with EmRata, as well as “But how do you read so much?” from Pandora Sykes’s newsletter. Mich recommended Next in Fashion on Netflix.
Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. If you want to try quality products that tackle your stubborn pimples while supporting the skin’s moisture barrier, you can find CeraVe’s new Blemish Control range exclusively at Chemist Warehouse.

      <title>The Hollywood Philanderers: Arnold Schwarzenegger</title>
      <description>Hey, legends!
Today, we’re welcoming our second philanderer to this series, Arnold Schwarzenegger. He’s the bodybuilder turned Hollywood A-lister who commanded $30 million for a film. But perhaps Arnold Schwarzenegger’s best acting happened within the walls of his home, under his wife’s nose, for over a decade.
Big thanks to Elite Eleven for making this episode possible. Get up to 50 percent off storewide from the 15th of March to the 21st of March. During this sale period, our code ‘SHAMELESS10’ will be inactive but outside those times, you can use it to get a cheeky 10 percent off.

      <title>Not the matching necklaces</title>
      <description>Hello, friends!
On today’s show: The Vanderpump Rules scandal might just be the juiciest thing to happen to reality TV in years. Then, the Weeknd’s HBO series might be in turmoil, Avril Lavigne and Tyga are officially “on”, Selena Gomez gains 15 million followers in the space of the week, and why exactly is Zoe Foster Blake and Go-To appearing in so many headlines right now?
This week, Mich recommended heading to Melbourne’s Regent Theatre to watch the new musical &amp; Juliet. Zara recommended the piece in The Atlantic titled, ‘The puzzling gap between how old you are and how old you think you are’.
Big thanks to Cashrewards for making this episode possible. If you sign up to Cashrewards today with the code ‘SHAMELESS’, you’ll receive an additional $20 bonus cashback on your first shop.
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘follow’ on Apple and Spotify. (Bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too!)

      <title>The Hollywood Philanderers: David Letterman (Part two)</title>
      <description>Hi, friends!
Welcome to part two of our series on Hollywood Philanderers. After David Letterman was blackmailed in 2009, he made a shocking on-air confession. The admission that might’ve cost him his career today was, at the time, practically forgotten about within the week — until one ex-employee revealed her story.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.
Big thanks to Dementia Australia and their Eat.Play.Rest campaign for making this episode possible. Their Instagram handle is @eatplayrestaustralia if you want to follow along and enter the competition to be in the running to win the ultimate Bondi beach getaway weekend. Head to eatplayrest.org.au and subscribe to get the best of Eat.Play.Rest straight to your inbox.

      <description>Hey, everyone!
On today’s show: The Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber drama just went nuclear and our heads are a mess. Then, the country music cheating scandal that involves a… chainsmoker… a celebrity boxing match, Avril Lavigne’s broken engagement might be as messy as they come, and an article in The Times UK that we simply can’t stop thinking about.
This week, Zara recommended ‘The terrifying cult of 'good taste'’ from the newsletter Things Worth Knowing with Farrah Storr. Mich recommended her sister Claire’s new podcast, The Moment, as well as Are You Happy Now by Hanna Jameson.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: The Thursday Murder Club</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7xuIS9m0yhNfm0uJYoENp3?si=2e36aea4308f4061

Hello, book club friends!
This month, we read ‘The Thursday Murder Club’ by Richard Osman. This number one best-seller takes place in a peaceful retirement village, where four unlikely friends meet up once a week to investigate unsolved murders. But when a brutal killing takes place on their very doorstep, the Thursday Murder Club find themselves in the middle of their first live case. Elizabeth, Joyce, Ibrahim and Ron might be pushing eighty but they still have a few tricks up their sleeves. Can this unorthodox but brilliant gang catch the killer before it's too late?
Got some thoughts on our March pick, ‘Alone With You In The Ether’ by Olivie Blake? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to Penguin Books Australia and ‘Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?’ by Dr Julie Smith for making this episode possible. To grab yourself a copy, head to the Penguin website and search ‘Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?’. Or, follow this link.

Hello, book club friends!
This month, we read ‘The Thursday Murder Club’ by Richard Osman. This number one best-seller takes place in a peaceful retirement village, where four unlikely friends meet up once a week to investigate unsolved murders. But when a brutal killing takes place on their very doorstep, the Thursday Murder Club find themselves in the middle of their first live case. Elizabeth, Joyce, Ibrahim and Ron might be pushing eighty but they still have a few tricks up their sleeves. Can this unorthodox but brilliant gang catch the killer before it's too late?
Got some thoughts on our March pick, ‘Alone With You In The Ether’ by Olivie Blake? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to Penguin Books Australia and ‘Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?’ by Dr Julie Smith for making this episode possible. To grab yourself a copy, head to the Penguin website and search ‘Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?’. Or, follow this link.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘subscribe’ on Apple (bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too) or ‘follow’ on Spotify. 
Still not enough? Well! Our hearts! See below for everything else.

      <title>“Omg, more like A MURDER SCENE”</title>
      <description>Hello, pals!
On today’s show: A big old quick and dirty, from Roxy Jacenko’s $40,000 “mastermind mentoring program” that’s causing a stir, the rise and rise of buccal fat removal, a tell-all memoir about an Aussie media boss’s many affairs, another Instagram post from Megan Fox about Machine Gun Kelly, and what we make of the comments left on a TikTok video by Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber.
This week, Mich recommended Physical 100 on Netflix. Zara gave two recommendations today! This episode of The Drop about Magic Mike, as well as Romantic Comedy by Curtis Sittenfeld (available in April but you can pre-order it now).
Big thanks to the brand new Stan Original Series, Bad Behaviour for making this episode possible. Make sure you check out the brand new Stan Original Series, Bad Behaviour, now streaming, only on Stan.

      <description>Hello, everybody!
On today’s show: the best and worst moments from the 2023 Grammys - including Harry Styles’s claim that “this doesn’t happen to people like me very often”. Plus! The modern etiquette rules that have divided social media, a new era of influencer non-apologies, Prince Harry’s older woman isn’t even that old, and what on Earth is happening in J Lo and Ben Affleck’s marriage: two viral videos have shown them bickering in the last ten days, and just about everyone on the internet is calling themselves a lip reader.
This week, Mich recommended Scenes From A Marriage on Binge. Zara recommended making Julia Busuttil Nishimura's green risotto with stracciatella and lemon.
Big thanks to KX Pilates for making this episode possible. Head to kxpilates.com and follow the prompts to check out their awesome introductory offer of five classes for $60.

      <title>Bam! And she eats the table</title>
      <description>Hiya, friends!
On today’s show: Blake Lively will star in the movie adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s best selling book It Ends With Us, and people have lots to say about that casting decision. Plus, The Bachelors finale delivered some… interesting results, a couple of Aussie actors might have “beef”, while two American actors publicly resolve theirs. And then - the pop culture story of the week. Tiktokker Mikayla Nogueira posted a sponsored mascara video that’s made millions of people very, very grumpy.
This week, Mich recommended Paul Mescal’s podcast interview on Off Menu. Zara didn’t have a rec this week so handballed it over to Annabelle, who recommended The Last of Us on Binge.
Big thanks to Lo Bros Not Soda for making this episode possible. Lo Bros Not Soda cans are available in select Independent supermarkets across Australia.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7wP79hKVP05GwnmoSfdWsS?si=3971df674d744214

Happy Saturday, bookworms!
This month, we read ‘Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow’ by best-selling author Gabrielle Zevin. The novel is, at its core, a love story between two brilliant gamers, but not a love story in the way you’d expect. Sadie and Sam form a friendship as children in a hospital gaming room and re-kindle as 25-year-olds years later at a train station. The natural connection that bonded them as kids instantly resumes, and, strengthened by their shared interest in video games, they become intrinsically linked as business partners, collaborators, and best friends. Together with the help of Sam’s housemate Marx and Sadie’s ex-professor slash lover Dov, they create the blockbuster hit, Ichigo, catapulting Sadie and Sam into great gaming success. With the wins though, came the losses - losses that shook their friendship and world entirely.
Got some thoughts on our February pick, ‘The Thursday Murder Club’ by Richard Osman? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to Quay Australia for making this episode possible. To browse their latest range head over to quayaustralia.com.au and pick out your pair for this summer. Don’t forget to jump on while their Buy 1, Get 1 free promotion is still running.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>It's just not that smoky</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone!
On today’s show: deep diving the The Great Australian Brawl - how did some of our biggest local celebrities have their argument filmed, sold and shared to the country last week? Then, Kylie Jenner’s baby officially has a name almost one year after being born, we need to talk about those viral Aaron Taylor-Johnson cheating rumours, Austin Butler’s new voice might be here to stay, and why on Earth is everyone in Dubai right now?
This week, Mich recommended this Creamy Brie Pasta Recipe from Jar of Lemons. Zara recommended deleting Instagram Monday to Friday like she’s been doing for the past couple of months! ‘How (and Why) Ryan Dumped His iPhone’ from The Imperfects was the episode Zara mentioned here.

      <title>The life of Lindsay Lohan: Part two</title>
      <description>Hello, everybody!
Welcome to part two of our series on Lindsay Lohan. By the time she was 19, Lindsay Lohan was on top of Hollywood. She had more talent and charisma than directors had seen in years. Only, sometimes fame, money and attention can be the last thing a young person needs.

      <title>Garfield was number one</title>
      <description>G’day, friends!
On today’s show: The 27-year-old Melbournian who is now “married” to Kanye West, the rise of Amelia Dimoldenberg and her red carpet chemistry with Andrew Garfield, Selena Gomez’s new boyfriend is an… interesting character, and Miley Cyrus has cemented herself as the Queen of the revenge hit: her new song ‘Flowers’ is everywhere right now, and there are plenty of reasons to believe it’s an open letter to her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth.
This week, Mich recommended watching A Man Called Otto at your local cinema. Zara recommended Break Point on Netflix.
Our latest release of charity merch has just dropped! We’ve got Shameless tote bags and caps to sort you all out this summer - head here to get your hands on a bundle.

      <title>“False!!!!! But also slay”</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone! We’re baaaaack!
And boy do we have some catching up to do. Paul Mescal and Phoebe Bridgers may well be over, we obviously need to talk about the Fitzroy Garage Party, a former reality star and another white powder scandal, and then, since when did Selena Gomez and Nicola Peltz Beckham become best friends? Plus, the fast rise of Tiktoker Alix Earle, the Bachelors premieres to dismal ratings and a real housewife finds herself behind real bars.
This week, Mich recommended Sports Bizarre’s Melbourne Cup episode, Wednesday on Netflix, and Pineapple Street by Jenny Jackson. Zara recommended Bodies of Light by Jennifer Down, You Be Mother by Meg Mason, ‘The Greatest Life Hacks in the World (for Now)’ by David Brooks, and this Ben Simmons profile. 
Big thanks to Pureology for making this episode possible. If you’re interested in incorporating Pureology’s Beach Waves Sugar Spray in your hair styling routine you can purchase it in salon, or online at Adore Beauty.
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘follow’ on Apple and Spotify. (Bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too!)

      <title>How Harry did it: Part three</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, friends!
Welcome to the third and final part of our series on One Direction. It was always pretty obvious that Harry Styles was the brightest star in the band. So when One Direction split in 2016, it was no surprise that he doggedly pursued a solo career. Here, we chart his ascension to total superstardom.
Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.
Head here for the piece in The Guardian we mentioned, and here for Harry’s Better Homes &amp; Gardens profile.
Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. If you want to try out CeraVe’s quality products, head to Chemist Warehouse or Adore Beauty.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/14CUMdJOw5adOtThHdk04K?si=c28253ae0346439c

Hiya, book clubbers!
This month, we read You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty by Akwaeke Emezi. This is a book that flips the romance genre utterly on its head. It’s been five years since protagonist Feyi lost her husband in a car accident. Feyi isn’t ready for anything serious, but a steamy encounter at a rooftop party cascades into a whirlwind summer she could have never imagined: a luxury trip to a tropical island, decadent meals in the glamorous home of a celebrity chef, and a major curator who wants to launch her art career. She’s even started dating the perfect guy, but there’s a bit of a problem: Feyi feels a deep thrill every time she locks eyes with the one person in the house who is most definitely off-limits.
Got some thoughts on our January pick, ‘Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow’ by Gabrielle Zevin? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to The Squiz for making this episode possible. If you’re keen to listen to their pods, you can find ‘Squiz Today’ or ‘Squiz Shortcuts’ in your favourite podcast app now. And don’t forget to sign up for their newsletter here.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>The 2022 SEOYAs</title>
      <description>G’day, everybody!
On today’s show: the 2022 SEOYAs - that is, the 2022 Shameless End of Year Awards. Today, we’re recapping some of our favourite recommendations of the year, and we’re looking back at the pop culture stories that shaped 2022. We’re also going to share with you a little bit of ‘behind the scenes’ - what segments we loved, what we have slight regret about maybe, and what we’re taking away from the year. 
You can vote for your winners on the Shameless Instagram account in this week’s Your Say Friday. Cast your votes on Friday at midday over on @shamelesspodcast.
This week, Zara recommended reading ‘Titanic’s Greatest Unsolved Mystery Involves a Conga Line, P.C.P., and an Unidentified Chowder’ in Vanity Fair. Mich and Zara also spoke about their favourite recs of 2022! Head here to listen to 'Dr Emily - Truth vs Harmony' on The Imperfects, and here to read/listen to I’m Glad My Mom Died by Jennette McCurdy.
Big thanks to Cashrewards for making this episode possible. Cashrewards is free to join and if you use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at the checkout, you will receive a bonus $20 cashback on your first shop as a welcome bonus.

      <description>Hello, everyone!
On today’s show: Kate Ritchie slams the Daily Mail for a gross intrusion of privacy. Say hello to Taylor Swift’s directing era, The White Lotus cements itself as the most culturally relevant TV show of 2022, Abbie Chatfield sparks a national conversation about slut-shaming, and last but certainly not least, our thoughts on the first three episodes of Harry and Meghan’s Netflix series.
This week, Mich recommended listening to Billy McFarland on Diary of a CEO. Zara recommended reading Here is the Beehive by Sarah Crossan.
Head here for the segment on It’s A Lot with Abbie Chatfield that we recommended listening to in full.

      <description>Hey, friends!
On today’s show: The Good Morning America extra-marital affair that’s absolutely dominating the headlines. Then, the full trailer for Harry and Meghan’s Netflix docu-series is here and, naturally, the internet is bursting with opinions. Plus, Britain’s biggest influencer Molly-Mae has shed some light on what her relationship has been like while pregnant, and, well, we wade through our complicated feelings about it.
This week, Zara recommended reading ‘My boyfriend, a writer, broke up with me because I’m a writer’ by Isabel Kaplan in The Guardian. For those of you may may require one, Mich recommended getting one of those telephones that record voice messages at weddings.

      <title>I don't know how else to do it, baby</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, everyone!
On today’s show: What the hell is going on with Balenciaga and that ad campaign? Shawn Mendes might be dating his much-older chiropractor, Pete Davidson definitely wants us to think he’s dating Em Rata, Channel 10’s latest reality show is also its latest flop, and then we finally return to the Shameless mailbag: what to do about your friend’s incredibly messy social media activity?
This week, Mich gave us two recommendations: Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus and this Channel 9 article about car park fines. Zara recommended The Successor by Paddy Manning.

Happy Saturday, book club friends!
This month, we read Coco Mellors’s best-selling debut novel, Cleopatra and Frankenstein. The book follows 24-year-old British artist Cleo, whose chance meeting with a man called Frank (who is some 20 years older than her), changes the course of both of their lives. In Frank, Cleo finds a future where she can paint, be happy and, well, land a green card. When the darkest parts of each of them meet each other, Frank and Cleo are forced to reckon with their demons, what it means to be their best selves and what it is they actually want out of their future.

      <title>Nepo baby blunders</title>
      <description>Hello, pals!
On today’s show: It’s all over for Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde, Lily-Rose Depp launches herself headfirst into a nepo baby conversational fire, Brooklyn Beckham tells the world he is a nutter in the kitchen while trying to convince us we need a tutorial for a gin and tonic, and THEN, what’s going on with Taylor and Ticketmaster?
This week, Zara recommended two columns from Haley Nahman’s newsletter: ‘On cosmetic procedures and the limits of "destigmatization”’ and ‘Re: getting work done’. Annabelle recommended watching Stutz on Netflix.
To read that Vox piece about Ticketmaster, head here.

On today’s show: It’s all over for Harry Styles and Olivia Wilde, Lily-Rose Depp launches herself headfirst into a nepo baby conversational fire, Brooklyn Beckham tells the world he is a nutter in the kitchen while trying to convince us we need a tutorial for a gin and tonic, and THEN, what’s going on with Taylor and Ticketmaster?
This week, Zara recommended two columns from Haley Nahman’s newsletter: ‘On cosmetic procedures and the limits of "destigmatization”’ and ‘Re: getting work done’. Annabelle recommended watching Stutz on Netflix.

      <title>Are we… Raquelle?</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone!
On today’s show: Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk are back on we would like to know if we are the only ones that care about that? Plus, rumours about Pheobe Bridgers and Paul Mescal being engaged are veering into conspiracy theory territory, Johnny Depp makes a controversial appearance at Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty show and drama at the finale of the Block. Then, of course, we need to talk about Selena Gomez’s new documentary Mind and Me and Selena fans have such a problem with her best friend, Raquelle.
This week, Mich recommended watching “Getting Heavy” with Parkway Drive on Australian Story. Zara recommended listening to the podcast episode called ‘What Makes Jacquemus So Successful?’ from The Debrief.

      <itunes:summary>Hello, everyone!
On today’s show: Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk are back on we would like to know if we are the only ones that care about that? Plus, rumours about Pheobe Bridgers and Paul Mescal being engaged are veering into conspiracy theory territory, Johnny Depp makes a controversial appearance at Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty show and drama at the finale of the Block. Then, of course, we need to talk about Selena Gomez’s new documentary Mind and Me and Selena fans have such a problem with her best friend, Raquelle.
This week, Mich recommended watching “Getting Heavy” with Parkway Drive on Australian Story. Zara recommended listening to the podcast episode called ‘What Makes Jacquemus So Successful?’ from The Debrief.

      <description>Hello hello!
On today’s show: People are mad about Billie Eilish’s Halloween costume, and we have a potentially unpopular opinion on it all. Rihanna’s released her first single in six years, Nicola Peltz-Beckham is back in the headlines for the 4000th time this year, radio’s golden girl Kate Ritchie is reportedly on the out, Matthew Perry’s arch nemesis is… Keanu Reeves? And then, we hear Zara’s two cents: is this the smartest celebrity on the internet right now? 
This week, Zara recommended listening to Kate Reid on The Imperfects and watching season two of The White Lotus on Binge. Mich recommended watching The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City on hayu.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Seeing Other People</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0GE2gcv3W20yNKAHaWphWu?si=68074612b7ed419d

Hello, book clubbers!
This month, we read Aussie author Diana Reid’s second novel, Seeing Other People. Seeing Other People follows two sisters, Eleanor and Charlie, living two very different lifestyles in Sydney after lockdown. When the novel begins, Eleanor has a corporate job and is in a relationship with Mark, Charlie is an actress living in a sharehouse with friends (namely, her long-time crush Helen). Then, all these characters suddenly collide, and Eleanor and Charlie’s seemingly sturdy bond is put to the ultimate test. Annabelle got to interview the very clever Diana Reid for this one - we will play that chat in the second half of this episode.
Got some thoughts on our November pick, ‘Cleopatra and Frankenstein’ by Coco Mellors? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to Simon and Schuster Australia for making this episode possible. Head to any good bookstore or online to get your hands on It Starts With Us - the highly anticipated sequel to It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

Hello, book clubbers!
This month, we read Aussie author Diana Reid’s second novel, Seeing Other People. Seeing Other People follows two sisters, Eleanor and Charlie, living two very different lifestyles in Sydney after lockdown. When the novel begins, Eleanor has a corporate job and is in a relationship with Mark, Charlie is an actress living in a sharehouse with friends (namely, her long-time crush Helen). Then, all these characters suddenly collide, and Eleanor and Charlie’s seemingly sturdy bond is put to the ultimate test. Annabelle got to interview the very clever Diana Reid for this one - we will play that chat in the second half of this episode.
Got some thoughts on our November pick, ‘Cleopatra and Frankenstein’ by Coco Mellors? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to Simon and Schuster Australia for making this episode possible. Head to any good bookstore or online to get your hands on It Starts With Us - the highly anticipated sequel to It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover.
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘subscribe’ on Apple (bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too) or ‘follow’ on Spotify. 
Still not enough? Well! Our hearts! See below for everything else.

      <description>Hellooooo, everyone!
On today’s show: Who is YungSweetRo and what do we make of the rumours that Travis Scott has been cheating on Kylie? Sophie Cachia announces that her engagement to professional basketballer Maddie Garrick has been called off, who the hell is advising James Corden right now? We can now name the A-lister who reportedly had a fling with Harry Styles before Olivia Wilde, and then: the biggest moment in music in the last decade - Midnights, the tenth studio album by Taylor Swift has dropped, and there’s so very much to unpack.
This week, Mich recommended Sol de Janeiro’s Brazilian Bum Bum Cream. Zara recommended ‘A Portrait of the Artist as Taylor Swift’ from Into It: A Vulture Podcast With Sam Sanders, as well as Bad Sisters on Apple TV.

      <description>Happy Monday, everybody!

      <description>Hello, mates!
On today’s show: Em Rata has launched a podcast that seems… an awful lot like another podcast. Why James Corden was banned - then unbanned - from a New York City restaurant, Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber had a way better plan than leaving a love heart emoji on each other’s TikToks, Drew Barrymore explains why she’s A-OK with going years without sex, and then: the nanny has spoken. Oh, god, has the nanny spoken. Which means the extremely messy split between Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis, somehow, just got messier.
This week, Mich recommended ‘The heaviest pain in the world - Rob Delaney on his son’s death’ in The Times UK. Zara recommended listening to ‘We Started As An Affair’ on Where Should We Begin? with Esther Perel.

      <title>Bec and Lleyton: Part two</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, everybody!
Welcome to part two of our series on Bec and Lleyton Hewitt. In 2005, Australian women’s magazines were in love with the Hewitts. But in the space of a year or two, the mood completely changed. So, how did Bec and Lleyton go from being the tabloid’s darlings, to being the tabloid’s enemies?

      <title>Now Mich’s got time</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, pals!
On today’s show: Kanye West has his social media accounts locked and draws the ire of Gigi Hadid, why Prince Harry’s memoir might never be released, Carrie Bickmore departs The Project, the oh-so juicy claims that this year’s Miss USA pageant was “rigged”, and then, it feels like every corner of the internet is declaring “thin is in”. If that’s the case, who’s to answer for it?
This week, Mich recommended watching Marriage on ABC iView and reading ‘What I Know’ by Jessica Knoll in Lenny Letter. Zara recommended watching Virgin River on Netflix and listening to ‘Laughing About The Thing That Just Happened’ on Hamish and Andy’s The Remembering Project.

      <description>Hello, friends!
On today’s show: Best mates Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne are involved in some ugly headlines about a paparazzo, the Beckham’s family feud might just be over, Bella Hadid is *the* face of the modelling industry right now, whoever is doing Emma Chamberlain’s PR deserves a raise, and then: Zara’s two cents - why, after so many years, will Hailey Bieber still not say Selena Gomez’s name?
This week, Mich recommended going to see Don’t Worry Darling. Zara recommended Mel C’s interview on The Diary of a CEO.

      <title>The YouTuber series: Bye Sister (Part two)</title>
      <description>Hello, everyone!
Welcome to the second and final part of our series on James Charles and Tati Westbrook. On May 10, 2019, Tati Westbrook posted the ‘Bye Sister’ video, which brought James Charles’s career crashing down. Only, within 12 months, the story behind YouTube’s biggest scandal ever would be totally and utterly flipped on its head.

      <itunes:summary>Hello, everyone!
Welcome to the second and final part of our series on James Charles and Tati Westbrook. On May 10, 2019, Tati Westbrook posted the ‘Bye Sister’ video, which brought James Charles’s career crashing down. Only, within 12 months, the story behind YouTube’s biggest scandal ever would be totally and utterly flipped on its head.

      <title>Are the men actually OK?</title>
      <description>Gday gday gday. We have much to discuss.
On today’s show: YouTubers The Try Guys announce they’ve dumped Ned for cheating on his wife, The Bachelor has been very… suspiciously… postponed, the publicity machine of Adam Levine and Behati Prinsloo goes into overdrive, new music from Rihanna may well be on the horizon, and then! We need to talk about that viral TikTok video: is being an influencer really that hard?
This week, Zara recommended watching Tell Me Lies on Disney+. Mich recommended watching the Robbie Williams and Delta Goodrem performance at the AFL Grand Final.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Black Cake</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/6CPf7JPJv66eMj53jUNXf1?si=19ed6e08e3e3427b

Hey there, book clubbers!
This month, we read the debut novel from author Charmaine Wilkerson, Black Cake. Black Cake is a novel that spans 60 years in the life of one Caribbean-American family. Byron and Benny’s mum, Eleanor Bennett, has died. She has left them a voice recording in which everything Byron and Benny ever knew about their family is upended.
Got some thoughts on our September pick? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to Aperol for making this episode possible. Don’t forget to upload a valid receipt on the MYY app showing you have purchased an Aperol Spritz and you’ll get your cash back, up to the value of $20 each. (Offer ends Novemeber 30, or until 100,000 Aperols have been claimed.)
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)
Want to support our show? We'd so appreciate you clicking 'follow' on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, and leaving a five-star review.

      <title>“Dude aren’t you, like, married?” </title>
      <description>Hellooooo mates!
On today’s show: Blake Lively is pregnant with baby number four, Kim Kardashian and Scott Disick are being sued for tens of millions, everyone is talking about the state of Tammy Hembrow’s relationship, Trisha Paytas’s baby name is… not what we were expecting… and then: Adam Levine has been publicly accused of cheating on his supermodel wife, Behati Prinsloo. And - apparently - he wanted to name their unborn child after his mistress. 
This week, Zara recommended listening to Lewis Capaldi on Diary of a CEO. Mich recommended watching Heartbreak High on Netflix.
Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? Join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.
Big thanks to Maybelline and their SuperStay range for making this episode of Shameless possible. If you are ready to try out Maybelline New York’s longwear SuperStay range for yourself, it’s available in-store and online at Chemist Warehouse.

      <title>The YouTuber series: Tanacon</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, everyone!
In 2018, Tana Mongeau was already one of YouTube’s most controversial personalities. But her decision to throw a self-titled content creator festival to rival VidCon? Well, that would make her name so notorious, even New York Magazine couldn’t look away.

      <title>Everybody’s feuding, darling</title>
      <description>Hey, friends!
On today’s show: Lea Michele addresses the bizarre but increasingly popular conspiracy theory that she can’t read, Kanye West’s years-long collab with Adidas is on the brink of collapse, Spencer Pratt says Lisa Kudrow “is one of the worst humans I’ve come in contact with”, and Don’t Worry Darling has FINALLY premiered at Venice. Only, at the last minute, “Miss Flo” pulled out of her only proper media commitment. Yet again, we have sooooo much to talk about.
This week, Zara recommended The September Issue on Stan. Mich recommended Mark Wilson from Jet on The Imperfects.

      <title>Fergie and Prince Andrew: Part three</title>
      <description>Hello, everybody!
Today, we’re heading back to 2011. We’ve given you the story of how Fergie and Prince Andrew met, married and broke up.

Welcome to the third episode of a new series by Shameless Media - Andrew and Fergie: A Very Royal Scandal.
A trigger warning for this one: it will detail allegations of sexual abuse and suicide. Listener discretion is advised. If you need help, call Lifeline on 11 13 14. 
All the links we mentioned in today’s episode are below:
Perversion of Justice: Jeffrey Epstein
The Relentless Ego of Ghislaine Maxwell
“I Collect People, I Own People”: The Curious Sociopathy of Jeffrey Epstein

Happy Saturday, book club fam!
This month, we read the incredible memoir from writer Amy Bloom, called In Love. In January 2020, Amy traveled to Switzerland with her husband Brian where he was helped by Dignitas to end his life after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's. The book details their love story, Brian’s slow decline, and Amy’s doggedness in ensuring her husband died with dignity. It’s a book about love, agency, and grief and encourages the reader to think a lot about what it means to live, and what it means to die. It was a heavy one, but a beautiful one. 
Got some thoughts on our September pick, ‘Black Cake’ by Charmaine Wilkerson? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.
Big thanks to Libra and their Period Proof Undies for making this episode possible. You can find Libra’s Period Proof Undies at your local Coles, Woolies, local pharmacy, or over at LoveLibra.com.au. Don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at the checkout for 20% off the Period Undies range via their website. 
You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)
Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘subscribe’ on Apple (bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too) or ‘follow’ on Spotify. 
Still not enough? Well! Our hearts! See below for everything else.

On today’s show: The New York Times has officially jumped on the Matilda Djerf Bandwagon, Harry Jowsey’s determined to sleep with more people than his mum, it appears Abbie Chatfield and Konrad Bień-Stephen are over, Andrew Tate has been deplatformed by just about every social media site under the sun, Brooklyn Beckham has been slammed AGAIN, and then!!! The return of the Shameless Mailbag - what exactly should you do if your best friend’s fiance confesses his undying love for you?
This week, Zara recommended this Nancy Meyers interview in Vulture, as well as ‘Life Isn’t Like the Movies (Even if You Write the Movies)’ by Nancy Meyers for The New York Times. Mich recommended watching ‘Untold: The Girlfriend Who Didn't Exist’ on Netflix.

      <title>E.T. is cancelled but Tommy Senior stays</title>
      <description>Hellooooo friends!

On today’s show: The image of Tommy’s Lee’s peen is now forever embedded into our brains, Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis’s court documents have been leaked to the media, are you guilty of “the millennial pause” and if you are, what does that mean? And then, Michelle’s Two Cents - why the hell do influencers keep trying to post on their ‘Close Friends’ Instagram story?

This week, Zara recommended watching ‘Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain’ on Amazon Prime or Apple TV. Mich recommended ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’ by Jennette McCurdy.

      <itunes:summary>Hellooooo friends!

On today’s show: The image of Tommy’s Lee’s peen is now forever embedded into our brains, Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis’s court documents have been leaked to the media, are you guilty of “the millennial pause” and if you are, what does that mean? And then, Michelle’s Two Cents - why the hell do influencers keep trying to post on their ‘Close Friends’ Instagram story?

This week, Zara recommended watching ‘Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain’ on Amazon Prime or Apple TV. Mich recommended ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’ by Jennette McCurdy.

To read that Brooklyn Beckham profile in Variety, head here.

      <description>Hello, lovely people!

      <title>The most Googled man on Earth</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, fam!

On today’s show: We finally have all the details on the now-infamous Elle Ferguson and Joel Patfull Block walkout, Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson are officially over, Kevin Federline has given a very unnecessary exclusive to the Daily Mail, there’s been a series of MAFS breakups that we are professionally obligated to talk about, the $90 million Batgirl film has been canned despite being near completion and - LAST BUT NOT LEAST - inside the bizarre world of Andrew Tate, one of the most Googled people in the world right now.

This week, Mich recommended going to see Six The Musical. Zara recommended Ed Sheeran’s interview on Desert Island Discs and Lewis Hamilton’s profile in Vanity Fair.

To read the Andrew Tate piece we mentioned from The Guardian, head here.

      <title>Omg there's even more to discuss</title>
      <description>Omg hi!!!!!! We’re back!

On today’s show, we went everywhere: From the rumours around Em Rata’s cheating husband and the Wagatha Christie trial coming to an end, to one man’s quest for Sammy Robinson’s heart and the biggest offenders when it comes to celebrities and their private jets. Plus! Is Shakira going to jail, why is a Deux Moi blind item about a high-profile royal making headlines, and finally, the Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde, Florence Pugh gossip we cannot get enough of.

This week, Mich recommended watching the movie adaption of Where the Crawdads Sing, The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, The Rehearsal on Binge, and The Split (thank you Zara! And Emily!). Zara recommended Nightcrawling by Leila Mottley, You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty by Akwaeke Emezi, and Seeing Other People by Diana Reid.

      <itunes:summary>Omg hi!!!!!! We’re back!

On today’s show, we went everywhere: From the rumours around Em Rata’s cheating husband and the Wagatha Christie trial coming to an end, to one man’s quest for Sammy Robinson’s heart and the biggest offenders when it comes to celebrities and their private jets. Plus! Is Shakira going to jail, why is a Deux Moi blind item about a high-profile royal making headlines, and finally, the Harry Styles, Olivia Wilde, Florence Pugh gossip we cannot get enough of.

This week, Mich recommended watching the movie adaption of Where the Crawdads Sing, The Body Keeps The Score by Bessel Van Der Kolk, The Rehearsal on Binge, and The Split (thank you Zara! And Emily!). Zara recommended Nightcrawling by Leila Mottley, You Made a Fool of Death with Your Beauty by Akwaeke Emezi, and Seeing Other People by Diana Reid.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: The Island of Missing Trees</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/4iWyeE7ZAkQCx7De1HmZ9b?si=a31f9875b4244ca4

Oh haaaaiiiii, book clubbers!
This month, we read ‘The Island of Missing Trees’ by award-winning Turkish-British author Elif Shafak. The book follows the love story between two teenagers, Kostas (a Greek Cypriot) and Defne (a Turkish Cypriot), whose forbidden romance means they can only meet at a taverna on the island between their homes. Witnessing their relationship through its ebbs and flows over the many years this story encompasses, is the fig tree that lives inside the taverna - the place of safety for Kostas and Defne. Shortlisted for the Women’s Prize for Fiction, ‘The Island of Missing Trees’ is an intergenerational story about past pain, tradition, and enduring love.

Got some thoughts on our August pick, ‘In Love’ by Amy Bloom? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to lululemon for making this episode possible. You can find their quality activewear over at lululemon.com.au or follow them on socials @lululemonausnz.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>Soothing our brains with gossip</title>
      <description>Hellooooo, legends!

On today’s show: It’s our last ep for a few weeks and all we wanna do is lean into the gossip. So, what’s the deal with the rumours that Victoria Beckham and her fresh daughter-in-law Nicola Peltz Beckham don’t get along? Plus, we obviously need to talk about the Robert Irwin glow-up, a MAFS lawsuit and the worst ratings in Aussie television history. Then, we open the Shameless mailbag: how are you meant to feel when you find out your male partner spent an evening out at a strip club?

This week, Zara had three recs! Adele’s interview on Desert Island Discs, The Split on Stan/ABC iView, and Farrah Storr’s newsletter article called ‘Why women cheat’. You can also subscribe to Farrah’s newsletter here. Mich recommended watching The Summer I Turned Pretty on Amazon Prime.

      <description>Happy Thursday, fam!!!

PARTICIPATE IN OUR 2022 LISTENER SURVEY HERE!

This week, Mich recommended the Halftime doco on Netflix. Zara recommended this interview with Dakota Johnson.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: The Wedding Party</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0upIFOFUFi4pOOPwtHuk6A?si=40e1fdacf8f64970

Happy Saturday, book club pals!

This month we read ‘The Wedding Party’ by New York Times bestselling novelist Jasmine Guillory. The book follows characters Maddie and Theo, who have two things in common: they share a best friend called Alexa, and they hate each other. Yet, underneath the sharp barbs they toss at one another is a simmering attraction that builds until they can’t resist sneaking off together when Alexa isn’t looking. This book is full of love, lust, and sex, which gives us oh so much to talk about.

Got some thoughts on our July pick, ‘The Island of Missing Trees’ by Elif Shafak? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to Flight Centre for making this episode possible. Flight Centre is giving 40 customers from all over the world the chance to win the ultimate holiday. How do you enter? Head to flightcentre.com.au and follow the prompts.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>“I’m a larrikin, I just do these things”</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, fam!!!

On today’s show: the hoax that had us all thinking Kim and Pete were in Cairns visiting local cafes, Hamish Blake wins the Gold Logie, Hailey Bieber launches skincare while Beyonce announces a new album and then, we open the Shameless mailbag: whaddyyaaa do if you really, really hate your best friend's partner?

This week, Mich recommended the Revealer Concealer by Kosas Cosmetics. Zara recommended listening to The Palace Papers audiobook by Tina Brown, and also brought us a hack! If you’re hearing Siri’s voice in your Airpods and don’t know how to turn it off, Zara’s gotchu. Go to your ‘Siri’ settings, then ‘announcements’, and then… turn off notifications.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

      <title>An It Boy’s photo scandal</title>
      <description>Hiya, lovely people!

On today’s show: An Aussie paper tried to out Rebel Wilson’s same-sex relationship and it sparked global backlash. Britney Spears’s star-studded wedding, Missy Higgins’ heartbreak, Jennifer Hudson makes history, and then, we dive deep into the Bailey Smith white powder controversy - the AFL’s most marketable star becomes the latest Aussie celebrity to be caught holding the bag (literally).

If you haven’t already (???), vote for Melissa Leong for the Gold Logie via this link!

This week, Mich recommended listening to UnReal - The Makeover Era: The Swan &amp; What Not to Wear. Zara recommended this Pandora Sykes with Tina Brown interview.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

Big thanks to Dyson and the new Dyson Airwrap™ Multi Styler for making this episode possible. Make sure you check out the new exclusive colourways available at Dyson.com.au.

      <title>A billion streams! Pew!</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, besties!!!!

On today’s show: Dolly Alderton’s Everything I Know About Love debuts, so how did we find one of the year’s most hyped shows? Plus, we need to talk about Liam Payne again, the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial comes to an end, rumours that Tammy Hembrow and her fiancé Matt Poole have split circulate days away from the birth of their child, and then! We go back to questions in a glass jar, and answer whatever question Annabelle picks out.

This week, Zara had two recommendations! Read ‘How to wang on about a royal wedding’ from Joe Elvin’s newsletter, then go listen to ‘Dr Emily - Truth vs Harmony’ from The Imperfects podcast. Mich recommended watching Anne Hathaway’s episode of Modern Love called ‘Take Me As I Am, Whoever I Am’.

      <title>This one’s for Bruno</title>
      <description>Hiya pals!

On today’s show: It turns out a bunch of Mormon TikTok influencers were partial to a bitta swinging, and the fallout has been oh so juicy. Then, Bec Judd’s Instagram Story about crime sparks a reply from the State Premier, Ellen Degeneres bids farewell to her talk show, the MAFS kissing video that we’d never like to hear about again, and THEN! We open the Shameless mailbag: what the hell do you do if your best friend says your wedding is becoming a huge financial burden?

This week, Mich recommended rewatching Little Women on Netflix. Zara recommended signing up to Eleanor Halls’ newsletter, PassTheAux.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Small Joys of Real Life</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/2mfjMujUxJEguGb1QmFcm7?si=d0ac08bc821944be

Oh haaaiiii, book clubbers!

This month, we read the debut novel from Aussie author Allee Richards called Small Joys of Real Life. The book follows Eva, a pretty successful local actor, who accidentally falls pregnant to a guy called Pat who she had met just a handful of times, but really, really liked. It’s just that by the time she realises she is pregnant, Pat has died, and she is forced to reckon with a world where she raises a baby to a father she misses but also never really knew. Flanked by her loyal but equally flawed best friends Sarah and Annie, Eva begins to question her career, her future, and even the people she surrounds herself with.

Got some thoughts on our June pick, ‘The Wedding Party’ by Jasmine Guillory? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to Conversations with Friends on Prime Video for making this episode possible. You can watch Conversations with Friends now on Prime Video, and if you don't yet have a subscription, you can score a 30-day free trial when you sign up right here.

The book follows Eva, a pretty successful local actor, who accidentally falls pregnant to a guy called Pat who she had met just a handful of times, but really, really liked. It’s just that by the time she realises she is pregnant, Pat has died, and she is forced to reckon with a world where she raises a baby to a father she misses but also never really knew. Flanked by her loyal but equally flawed best friends Sarah and Annie, Eva begins to question her career, her future, and even the people she surrounds herself with.</p><p><br></p><p>Got some thoughts on our June pick, ‘The Wedding Party’ by Jasmine Guillory?

      <description>Happy Thursday, fam!

On today’s show: A swimming love triangle, how to stop your man cheating according to Kyle Sandilands, and a spon con wedding for the ages: Travis and Kourtney got married (again), and this time, they’re dripping in Dolce and Gabbana. Plus, The Bachelor becomes the Bachelors, and then, someone finally uncovered who runs the anonymous gossip Instagram account DeuxMoi. But the real question is: does it actually matter?

This week, Mich recommended reading ‘Will the Depp/Heard hell trial never end?’ by Mary MacNamara in LA Times. Zara had a read rec too! ‘The worst career advice’ from Marie Andrew’s newsletter.

      <title>For the love of the lord, remove the jumpsuit</title>
      <description>Hello hellooooo!

On today’s show: Just, like, everything. There is so much to cover. From Kendall Jenner’s insane cucumber cutting technique, to Love Island breakups and blossoming Bachelors. Not to mention Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly cut a hole in a jumpsuit to have sex, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker got married again and theeeennn, The Inspired Unemployed have officially released Australia’s fastest-growing beer in 8 years, reporting 10 million in sales since launching: so let’s talk about their rise and the kinds of influencer-backed businesses that work.

This week, Zara recommended reading ‘Last Girlboss Standing’ in Bustle and listening to ‘Tom Tilley: losing my religion’ on ABC’s Conversations. Mich recommended The Teacher’s Trial podcast by The Australian.

      <title>When Kristen cheated on Rob: Part two</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, everybody!!!!

Welcome to part two of our Rob and Kristen series. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were something of a teenage dream. Actors who landed the roles of a lifetime when they were cast as the leading duo of the Twilight franchise. But their real-life love affair would go down in flames.

      <description>Hello friends!

On today’s show: Our money don’t jiggle jiggle, it folds, plus Guy Sebastian’s fraud case, a $71 million payday for The Bachelor’s Sam Wood, all our thoughts on that ‘Wagatha Christie’ trial, and then, a juicy Shameless mailbag: what do you do if your best friend is lying about her face?

This week, Mich recommended Pachinko on Apple TV and My Lying Eyes on This American Life. Zara recommended reading ‘Scene Stealer: The True Lies of Elisabeth Finch’ in Vanity Fair.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: An American Marriage</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ErhB2hnpJostmk6iVeTvO?si=ef5ac01ec9834236

Happy Saturday, book club besties!

This month, we read An American Marriage by Tayari Jones. The book follows newlyweds, Celestial and Roy. She’s an artist on the rise, he’s a young executive. They’re as happy as ever, until Roy is wrongfully imprisoned for a reprehensible crime. Celestial knows he is innocent, and their families and wider community trust that he is too, but Roy is still sentenced to twelve years in prison. After serving five years behind bars, Roy is unexpectedly set free, but things are not as he’d hoped back home in Atlanta. You see, in Roy’s absence, Celestial turned to find comfort in her childhood best friend, Andre.

To read that Tayari Jones interview in The Paris Review, head here.

Got some thoughts on our May pick, ‘Small Joys of Real’ Life by Allee Richard? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to New Balance and their new 574 Core range for making this episode possible. You can learn more about New Balance’s green leaf standard over on newbalance.com/env or if you want to get your hands on them yourself you can purchase via their website at newbalance.com.au.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <description>Good morning, lovely people!

On today’s show: ASAP Rocky’s arrest over an LA shooting, the latest on that ugly Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial, Elon Musk splashes his pocket money on buying Twitter, the rise of the coastal grandma trend and THEN! We rummage through the Shameless mailbag, what if you only uncover your partner’s lie, a year after it’s been told?

This week, Mich recommended the Diary of a CEO podcast episode with Ben Francis. Zara recommended watching White Hot on Netflix.

      <title>A bright idea: date a whale</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, besties!!!!

On today’s show: Coachella, of course! But are we crazy for sensing a vibe shift all the way over in Palm Springs this year? Plus, Elle Ferguson is forced to quit The Block three days in, the brand-new Kardashian show is here in the same week they’re being sued for $100 million and then we absolutely need to unpack those absolutely wild and false rumours about Rihanna and ASAP Rocky that had the internet in a stranglehold over the weekend.

This week, Zara recommended watching The Anatomy of a Scandal on Netflix and listening to Justin McLeod’s podcast episode on How I Built This with Guy Raz. Mich recommended Blackfish on Stan and The Ultimatum on Netflix.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

Big thanks to Maybelline New York and their NEW Colossal Curl Bounce Mascara for making this episode possible. You can find the Colossal Curl Bounce both online and in-store at Chemist Warehouse.

      <title>Proposals! Weddings! Babies!</title>
      <description>G’day, lovely people!

On today’s show: Weddings! Divorce! Babies! Britney is pregnant, Ed Sheeran sheds fascinating light on all those copyright cases in the music industry right now, JLo and Ben are engaged again and Lorde’s iconic “shooshing” moment. And then, all the details from Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz’s Palm Beach wedding and how one decision they made - to combine their names - sparked a veeeery interesting conversation in the Shameless office this week.

This week, Zara didn’t have a rec but Mich brought two! Mich recommended watching Australian Story: Trials and Tribulations on ABC iView, and to go see John Hastings at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.

      <description>Happy Thursday, pals!!!!

On today’s show: Bruce Willis’s aphasia diagnosis presents a dilemma: what happens to someone’s agency when they’re slowly slipping away? Plus, every headline that came out of the Grammys including Kourtney and Travis’ Vegas elopement, MAFS is finished for another year, and then, we open the mailbag: your best friend cheats on her partner. So, what happens to your friendship?

This week, Zara recommended watching this episode of INKtalks with Josh Radnor. Mich recommended season two of Bridgerton on Netflix.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

Big thanks to Extra White for making this episode possible. You can find Extra White sugar-free gum at your local Coles, Woolworths or Independent store.

      <title>The Slap</title>
      <description>Good morning, besties!

On today’s show: A jam-packed quick and dirty! Zendaya stuns on the Oscars red carpet, influencer Ruby Tuesday Matthews finds herself in a slightly awkward public predicament and the rise of short kings. And then? Oh, you already KNOW what’s coming after that: a big bumper segment on the slap that seized the world: Will Smith assaulted Chris Rock on stage at the Oscars and we have oh so very much to talk about.

This week, Mich recommended the episode of The Imperfects called ‘Hamish Blake - Let’s Talk About Self-Doubt’. Zara gave two recs this week! She recommended heading to Vanity Fair’s Instagram page to check out their photo sessions with celebrities from the Oscars After Party, and reading The Most Important Job In The World by Gina Rushton.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

Big thanks to Zonzo Estate for making this episode possible. You can find Zonzo Estate’s “Shameless Faves Pack” over on www.zonzo.com.au. (Available until the end of April this year.)

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Violeta</title>

Good morning, lovely book clubbers!

This month, we read Violeta by New York Times bestselling author Isabel Allende. This novel tells the epic story of Violeta del Valle, a woman whose life spans one hundred years and bears witness to the greatest upheavals of the twentieth century - the dissolution of a family fortune, a tempestuous marriage interspersed with love affairs, the machinations of family and friends over a century, all set against political upheaval in her homeland, an unnamed Latin American country.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara and Annabelle chat about Isabel Allende’s legacy, standout characters, and the question on Mich’s mind: Is Violeta a good person?

To read that Isabel Allende interview with Conversations on Love, head here.

Got some thoughts on our April pick, ‘An American Marriage’ by Tayari Jones? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to Loving Earth for making this episode possible. If you also want to learn a little more about Loving Earth's regenerative journey, head to lovingearth.net.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

Want to support our show? We are sending air kisses, air tea, and air hugs (too far?) to anyone who clicks ‘subscribe’ on Apple (bonus hugs for anyone who leaves a five-star review, too) or ‘follow’ on Spotify.

Still not enough? Well! Our hearts! See below for everything else.

      <title>Is the freebie really worth it?</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, lovelies!

On today’s show: Georgia Love’s influencer holiday to Saudia Arabia is slammed, Kylie Jenner’s baby isn’t called Wolf anymore, Molly-Mae makes a surprising move regarding her new home, NSW police are investigating that MAFS nude photo scandal, and then, a pretty wicked mailbag: is it OK to be offended if you’re not in a close friend’s bridal party?

This week, Zara recommended the miniseries WeCrashed on Apple TV+. Mich recommended Bad Vegan on Netflix.

      <description>Happy Monday, mates!

Today, we’re heading back to 1972. Ben Affleck had it all. Good looks, great talent, and a brilliant wife. Only, almost ten years into his marriage with Hollywood’s sweetheart, Ben decided to seek comfort in the arms of - you guessed it - his children’s nanny.

      <title>Talk soon, Cody xx</title>
      <description>HIYA, FRIENDS!

On today’s show: Grimes and Elon Musk have a baby that should be called X but will be known as Y. We can’t stop googling Kris Jenner’s church, Hailey Bieber is hospitalised for a blood clot in her brain, two Aussie vitamins companies are brawling on Instagram, and then, a Kim-athon. Kim Kardashian is typically all over the news cycle, but this week? Well, this week was something else. It's been a wild ride, from calling everyone lazy, to becoming Insta official with Pete Davidson, premiering her new show’s trailer, and those leaked text messages.

This week, Mich recommended season four of Drive to Survive on Netflix. Zara recommended watching Robbie Williams perform at Knebworth on YouTube.

Cody Simpson’s new album ‘CODY SIMPSON’ will be out on Friday, April 8! Make sure to check it out! And if you’d like to listen to Cody’s new single, ‘Let Go’, stream it here.

      <title>Byron Nays</title>
      <description>Good morning, besties!!!!!

On today’s show: The time has officially come - Netflix’s reality series Byron Baes has premiered and you better believe we have things to say about the first episode. Then, the death of Australian icon Shane Warne, Kanye West releases a music video depicting violence against Pete Davidson, and then, we open the Shameless mailbag: one listener had sex with a problematic A-list celebrity, and she’s full of regret.

This week, Zara recommended listening to The Ash London Podcast with Phoebe Simmons, as well as The Dropout on Disney Plus. Mich recommended Worst Roommate Ever on Netflix.

      <title>The end! Of influencing! As we know it!</title>
      <description>Hiiii, legends!

On today’s show: Two aspiring food bloggers absolutely cop it for asking a restaurant for free food, Amanda Bynes files to end her conservatorship after 9 years, and former Bachelor Locky Gilbert can’t believe you all work 9-5!!! How mundane! Plus, let’s talk about those headlines that claim influencers will soon be banned from spruiking things like skincare and sunscreen. Is it all as it seems?

This week, Mich recommended season two of Love is Blind on Netflix. Zara recommended reading The Ride of a Lifetime by Robert Iger.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: If I Had Your Face</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QwEMnlkuViVnaE47tVSug?si=3924aaf4f17f4bd1

Happy Saturday, book club fam!

This month, we read If I Had Your Face by Frances Cha. The novel is set in contemporary Seoul, Korea, and follows four young women making their way in a world defined by impossibly high standards of beauty, secret room salons catering to wealthy men, strict social hierarchies, and K-pop fan mania.

Today on the show, we chat about the world of plastic surgery in South Korea, standout characters, and the book’s strengths and weaknesses.

Got some thoughts on our March pick, ‘Violeta’ by Isabel Allende? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to Bed Threads for making this episode possible. Don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS10’ at the checkout for 10% off their entire range right here.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <description>Happy Thursday, pals!

On today’s show: What in the vibey hell is a Vibe Shift and why does everyone keep saying it’s coming? Plus, Britney’s Big Book Deal, how Brooke Hogan’s Instagram stories sparked a conversation in the Shameless office, and then, one of the more interesting mailbag entries we’ve read in ages.

This week, Zara recommended the series by The Cut called Both Sides Of A Breakup. Mich recommended the podcast Twin Flames by Wondery.

      <title>Making sense of Miley Cyrus: Part one</title>
      <description>G’day, friends!

Today, we’re heading back to 1992. Miley Cyrus became famous for playing Hannah Montana, a girl living a double life. Only in the real world, when she was still just a teenager, Miley found herself straddling two different worlds: child stardom and adulthood.

      <description>Hey, legends!!!

On today’s show: Well, there’s a lot. So much, we’re about to bring you the world’s most jam-packed quick and dirty, well, ever. We’re talking Kylie Jenner’s new baby, the potential end of iconic Aussie TV show Neighbours, an uncomfortable update on Armie Hammer, a royal typo to end all typos and then, world war Kardashian - Kanye and Kim air their grievances on social media, and how do we make sense of all of it?

This week, Zara recommended the Mark Manson episode of The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett. Mich recommended the ‘We Are Supported By’ podcast series by Armchair Expert, hosted by Kristen Bell and Monica Padman.

      <title>Who wants to be TikTok famous?</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday mates!

Coming up on today’s show: what the f**k is going on over at Spotify right now? Rihanna is pregnant and her announcement was the most Rihanna thing ever. Former TV star Andrew O’Keefe is accused of assaulting a woman - again. And THEN we open the Shameless Mailbag! Is this listener an asshole for judging her little sister’s quest for TikTok fame?

This week, Mich recommended a two-part series on This American Life called ‘A couple walks into a house’ and ‘A city walks into an investigation’. Zara recommended Steven Bartlett’s interview on How To Fail.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

      <title>Did Yoko Ono really break up The Beatles? Part one</title>
      <description>Editors note: an earlier version of this audio mentioned George Harrison’s name incorrectly on one occasion. This has now been fixed.

Hiya, lovelies!

Today, we’re heading back to 1940. She’s the woman you’ve likely heard disparaging remarks about since you were a little kid. So, who was Yoko Ono? And what exactly was her influence over the most successful band in music history?

Hellooooo, book clubbers!!!!

This month, we read the non-fiction book from bestselling Aussie author Trent Dalton called Love Stories. For about two months, Trent sat on a busy Brisbane street corner, asking more than 150 strangers for their best love stories. What sparked this idea? After the passing of his best mate’s mother and, well, a global pandemic, Trent felt like we all needed to hear some love stories.

Today on the show, we chat about our favourite stories and main takeaways from the book, and then! Annabelle interviews Trent Dalton himself at the very end of this episode.

Send Trent your love stories via the email address lovestoriesbox@gmail.com.

Got some thoughts on our February pick, ‘If I Had Your Face’ by Frances Cha? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to The Base Collective and their Beauty Sleep range for making this episode possible. The Base Collective has been kind enough to offer a 20% discount off the entire range when you use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at the checkout.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>2022’s very first influencer scandal</title>
      <description>Hiiiiii, everybody!

On today’s show: Who is West Elm Caleb and how has he become the real-life John Tucker Must Die? Adele controversially cancels her Las Vegas residency, the celebrity couple the gossip accounts discarded as a PR stunt welcome their first baby, how much Aussie public figures are paid to go on reality TV in 2022, and then, a big, juicy, bumper segment on Jade Tunchy - the local fashion influencer who found herself in the biggest scandal of her career this week.

This week, Zara recommended the Colleen Hoover book, Verity. Mich recommended watching The Rescue on Disney+.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

      <title>Excuse us, there's a lot to discuss</title>
      <description>We’re baaaaack!

And boy, do we have a bumper one for you - we’re chatting about everything we missed over the summer holidays. Everything from Brooke and Darvid’s break up, Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly’s engagement, the many January headlines of Kim and Kanye, and yes, of course, Molly-Mae’s now infamous quote about everyone having the same 24 hours in the day.

This week, Mich recommended Love Me on Binge, Before You Knew My Name by Jacqueline Bublitz, and Cruella on Disney Plus. Zara had a few books to recommend! If I Had Your Face by Frances Cha, Detransition, Baby by Torrey Peters, and our January book club pick, Love Stories by Trent Dalton.

      <title>How Taylor Swift rose, fell, and rose again: Part three</title>
      <description>Why hellooooo, lovelies!

Welcome to the third and final part of our Taylor Swift series. In 2016, the world celebrated the trashing of Taylor Swift’s reputation. Then, one night in August 2017, the popstar wiped her social media accounts clean. A total blank slate. Why? It was time for her reinvention.

For that 2019 profile of Taylor Swift in The Guardian, head here.

Welcome to the third and final part of our Taylor Swift series. In 2016, the world celebrated the trashing of Taylor Swift’s reputation. Then, one night in August 2017, the popstar wiped her social media accounts clean. A total blank slate. Why? It was time for her reinvention.

For that 2019 profile of Taylor Swift in The Guardian, head here.

      <description>Happy Monday, Swifties!

Today, we’re heading back to 1989. She's arguably the most powerful person in pop culture, but Taylor Swift’s story is littered with highs, lows, industry friends, and downright enemies. So, let’s retrace it all.

Hiya, book club besties!

This month, we read the New York Times Number One Best Seller: The Paper Palace by Miranda Cowley Heller. The story’s protagonist is Elle Bishop, a 50-something woman in love with two men - her husband, and her childhood best friend. As the blurb tells us, “so begins a story that unfolds over twenty four hours and across fifty years.” What is Elle’s big secret - the one that has kept her tethered to, but arms distance from, her best friend Jonas? And which man will she choose in the end?

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle go everywhere: from standout characters, to the theme of intergenerational trauma, before a big chat about that ending.

Got some thoughts on our January pick, ‘Love Stories’ by Trent Dalton? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to Olina’s Bakehouse Seeded Snackers for making this episode possible. Check out these yummy snacks right here, and find them in-store at your local Woolworths.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <description>It’s our final Thursday episode for 2021!

What were the biggest stories of the last twelve months, and how do we feel about them with the gift of hindsight? Plus, we name our top read, watch, and listen recommendations from the year that was, look back at our favourite podcast moments, and share the lessons we’ll be taking with us into 2022.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

Big thanks to CeraVe for making this episode possible. You can get your hands on CeraVe’s PM Facial Moisturising Lotion, as well as all of their other products, at your local Chemist Warehouse.

      <title>A 36-hour PR masterclass</title>
      <description>Good morning, pals!

On today’s show: How Peleton became the biggest story from this week’s SATC reboot, Olivia Wilde says she is “happier than ever” with Harry Styles and an Aussie influencer and business owner cops flak for comparing running a company to having a kid. Plus, Kim Kardashian wakes her kids up every morning with a Grammy-award winning pianist and then, a big bumper mailbag entry. Are you a stinge for caring if your friend is a stinge?

This week, Mich recommended listening to the podcast Sweet Bobby, and Zara recommended the podcast Harsh Reality: The Story of Miriam Rivera. Check out the Shameless recommendations spreadsheet, courtesy of listener Gen Lucas (we love u!!!!), right here.

      <title>Carrie, Samantha and Scandals in the City: Part one</title>
      <description>Oh hey, friends!

Today, we’re heading back to the 90s. It was the iconic television series - and then, not so iconic movie franchise - known for championing female friendships. Only, behind the scenes, all was not well between the actresses who brought us Carrie Bradshaw and Samantha Jones.

Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

Big thanks to Maybelline New York for making this episode possible. Shop the entire Maybelline range at Chemist Warehouse or online.

      <description>Happy Thursday, fam!!!!

On today’s show: Our take on the Brooke Blurton and Abbie Chatfield story that spilled out onto social media this week. Chanel is blasted for its shitty $1100 advent calendar, Tristan Thompson proves he is literally the worst yet again, Gwyneth Paltrow doesn’t remember… anything, and then, a leaked magazine spread proves to be a colossal headache for Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott.

This week, Zara recommended this Jeremy Strong profile from The New Yorker. Mich recommended listening to the podcast, Fallen Angel.

Big thanks to Dyson for making this episode possible. You can check out the Dyson Corrale hair straightener over on dyson.com.au as well as all of their other incredible hair tools.

      <title>Oh, the mess a TikTok video can make</title>
      <description>Good morning, lovely people!

On today’s show: The social media comments about Zara that sparked a conversation about women, smugness, and “pick me” culture. Then, Brooke Blurton’s Bachelorette finale makes Twitter erupt, the celebrity cheating rumour that’s looking increasingly legit, and then, a curious Shameless mailbag: what to do when you’re shamed in front of hundreds of thousands of people.

This week, Zara recommended getting your hands on the cookbook ‘Everything I Love To Cook’ by Neil Perry. Mich recommended season four of Selling Sunset on Netflix.

To read the Virgil Abloh profile in The Cut that we mentioned in today’s episode, head here.

Happy Saturday, book worms!

This month, we took on our first non-fiction book, a memoir from the now 28-year-old North Korean defector and activist, Yeonmi Park. Published in 2015, Yeonmi tells the story of the first 22 years of her life - from her first 13 years growing up in North Korea as it was consumed by famine, to fleeing over the border to China where she and her mother fell into the hands of human traffickers, and finally, to escaping to South Korea by traversing through the Gobi desert through the night in search of a better life.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle chat about all that Yeonmi so generously shared with her readers: Her childhood, the adversities faced in China, and the heartbreaking reality of life with newfound freedom.

Got some thoughts on our December pick, ‘The Paper Palace’ by Miranda Cowley-Heller? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to Organic Formulations for making this episode possible. You can find Organic Formulations at selected pharmacies and health food stores, or shop online right here. And don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS25’ at checkout for 25% off your order, plus free shipping.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>BOOK CLUB: The Henna Artist</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0cnR7JPXfbdZegoCkKcsVW?si=11875c1abc114a6e

Hey, book club besties!

This month, we read the incredible debut novel by Alka Joshi titled the Henna Artist. Following protagonist Lakshmi - one of Jaipur’s most in-demand Henna Artists - the novel tells the story of a woman running away from her past in 1950s India in order to forge her own path. But of course, there’s only so far she can run before her ex-husband and a sister she didn’t know existed turn up on her doorstep.

Hey, book club besties!

This month, we read the incredible debut novel by Alka Joshi titled the Henna Artist. Following protagonist Lakshmi - one of Jaipur’s most in-demand Henna Artists - the novel tells the story of a woman running away from her past in 1950s India in order to forge her own path. But of course, there’s only so far she can run before her ex-husband and a sister she didn’t know existed turn up on her doorstep. So, does their arrival mark the beginning of the end for Lakshmi’s new life? It’s a story about freedom of choice, domestic abuse, and arranged marriage, and boy was it a riveting read.

      <title>Guy + couch = chaos</title>
      <description>Hey friends!

On today’s show: How a random guy named Robbie, sitting on a couch with three women who were not his girlfriend, became the biggest trend on the internet this week. Then, a controversial Australian podcast interview draws attention for all the wrong reasons, and Shakira gets… mugged… by wild boars. Then, finally, a new Shameless segment: My Two Cents, where one of us comes to the table with a potentially terrible opinion.

This week, Zara recommended downloading the Vivino app. Mich had three recommendations! Britney Vs Spears on Netflix, Ted Lasso on Apple TV, and Louis Theroux: Mothers On The Edge on ABC iView.

      <description>Happy Thursday, lovely people!

On today's show: The Honey Badger saved a sheep from a wire fence and was that all it was going to take to win back the hearts of Australian women? Plus, the Sydney socialites making headlines, Will Smith talks non-monogamy with GQ, and then, another verrrrry intriguing mailbag: Would you tell someone you don’t know - ie. an influencer - if you saw their partner cheating on them?

This week, Mich recommended the podcast episode, ‘How Mail Order Marriages Work’, on Stuff You Should Know. Zara recommended watching Vigil on Binge.

      <title>The scandalous marriage of Victoria and David Beckham: Part one</title>
      <description>Happy Monday, besties!

Today, we’re heading back to the 90s. When David Beckham met Victoria Adams, he was so besotted he could barely speak. Little did the footballer know that together, they’d become one of the most powerful, famous, and yes, scandalous couples of the nineties and noughties.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: You and Me on Vacation</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/66sRsUb76DWcJ4sKuOHGSA?si=f71eb2f8b07e4904

Why hello there, book clubbers!

This month, we read ‘You and Me on Vacation’ by Emily Henry, and boy oh boy did it deliver on its promise to be a sugary, frothy read. Protagonists Alex and Poppy have nothing in common. She’s a wild child; he wears khakis. She has insatiable wanderlust; he prefers to stay home with a book. And somehow, ever since a fateful car-share home from college many years ago, they are the very best of friends. For most of the year they live far apart—she’s in New York City, and he’s in their small hometown—but every summer, for a decade, they go on holiday together. It’s a story of girl meets boy, girl befriends boy, girl falls in love with boy, girl loses boy, and then, finally, girl gets boy back.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle discuss the book’s structure, believability, ending, and eeeverything in between.

Got some thoughts on our October pick, ‘The Henna Artist’ by Alka Joshi? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to FOREO for making this episode possible. FOREO has been kind enough to offer a discount of 20% when you use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at the checkout right here, available until December 31st this year.

You can browse the eBook and audiobook versions of past book club picks in our room on Apple Books! Have a look-see right here. (You might spot our little baby, The Space Between, in the mix there, too.)

      <title>The most popular girl in the world</title>
      <description>Hiya pals!

On today’s show: The Gabby Petito true crime case that tore through TikTok this week. Then, the Brownlow blue carpet begs a question about redemption stories, Kim Kardashian lets us know we’ve all been utterly deceived, and finally - magazines have called Emma Chamberlain “the most popular girl in the world”. So, who is Emma, and how has she managed to redefine influence as we know it?

This week, Zara recommended the Schumacher documentary on Netflix. Mich recommended watching season three of Sex Education on Netflix.

Got some thoughts on today’s episode you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

This week, Mich had two recommendations! The Apple TV show Morning Wars, and the podcast episode ‘Break Ups That Burn’ on Where’s Your Head At. Zara recommended listening to the podcast The Dropout by ABC News.

      <title>The politics of being an 'It Girl'</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, lovely people!

On today’s show: Scott Disick proves why you should never, ever, take digs at your very famous ex in someone else’s Instagram DMs. The Dolce and Gabbana fashion show was paid a visit by mother nature, what to make of the semi-terrible movie that’s number one on the Netflix charts right now, and then - finally - the politics of being an “it girl”; the UK’s biggest influencer just made the biggest move of her career so far, but lots of people have been left feeling pretty ick about it.

This week, Mich recommended watching Ms Represented with Annabel Crabb on ABC iView. Zara recommended Nine Perfect Strangers on Amazon Prime and Fox and the Big Lie on ABC.

For that video of Dolce and Gabanna’s fashion show on Diet Prada’s Instagram, head here.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Fault Lines</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Qt4haOvZTsnOQMw1ftiFV?si=ae117cf720ae413e

Yaaaayyyyy! It’s book club day!

This month, we read the debut novel from Emily Itami called Fault Lines. Fault Lines follows the story of Mizuki, a Japanese housewife with two adorable children and an extremely hardworking husband. She has everything anyone could ever want, so why does the book open with her wanting to throw herself off a high-rise balcony rather than spend another evening folding laundry or being ignored by her husband? Then, Mizuki meets Kiyoshi, a successful restaurateur. He understands her, listens to her - hell, he even looks her in the eye when he is speaking. So, what is a woman like Mizuki to do when she finds herself at such a fork in the road?

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle discuss the intersection between motherhood, subservience, and the affair threaded throughout this novel, as well as what the ending said about the meaning of happiness.

Grab a copy of next month’s book club pick, ‘You and Me on Vacation’, via our affiliate link here.

Yaaaayyyyy! It’s book club day!

This month, we read the debut novel from Emily Itami called Fault Lines. Fault Lines follows the story of Mizuki, a Japanese housewife with two adorable children and an extremely hardworking husband. She has everything anyone could ever want, so why does the book open with her wanting to throw herself off a high-rise balcony rather than spend another evening folding laundry or being ignored by her husband? Then, Mizuki meets Kiyoshi, a successful restaurateur. He understands her, listens to her - hell, he even looks her in the eye when he is speaking. So, what is a woman like Mizuki to do when she finds herself at such a fork in the road?

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle discuss the intersection between motherhood, subservience, and the affair threaded throughout this novel, as well as what the ending said about the meaning of happiness.

      <title>Four big questions</title>
      <description>Good morning pals!

On today’s show: Jennifer Klein’s Day of Indulgence is apparently one of the most coveted invitations in LA, but we have a few questions we’d like to ask. Then, Channel 10’s dire The Bachelor ratings, unpacking Bama Rush and why it took over TikTok this week, and then, a new segment that we will be dropping whenever we feel like it: we open the Shameless Mailbag, and tackle an anonymous listener’s conversational challenge for reconnecting.

This week, Mich recommended watching Pistorius on Amazon Prime. Zara recommended Hacks on Stan.

If you’d like to write to the Shameless Mailbag, shoot an email to hello@shamelessmediaco.com. We’d love to hear from you.

      <title>The Seven Husbands of Elizabeth Taylor: Part one</title>
      <description>Happy Monday everyone!

Today, we’re heading back to 1932. Elizabeth Taylor was one of Hollywood’s greatest icons. But despite being known as the “most beautiful woman in the world”, she had a complicated love life filled with affairs, a shock death, and - yes - many, many divorces.

      <title>Where the truth lies</title>
      <description>G’day everyone!

On today’s show: Why do celebrities keep telling us how often - or not often - they bathe? Plus, an Instagram influencer calls out another for systematically copying her content, Jennifer Aniston’s very public birthday message to Justin Theroux, and then, the Good Weekend profile on Jock Zonfrillo that some are calling the most interesting and ~intriguing ~ celebrity profile in years.

This week, Mich recommended watching Would I Lie To You on ABC iView and Cooking With Paris on Netflix. Zara recommended listening to the This American Life episode, Switched at Birth. Annabelle also had a rec this week! The documentary, Val, on Amazon Prime.

Have a look at that compilation of Instagram photos we mentioned by heading here. And for that piece in The Atlantic about fact-checking, head here.

      <title>The cult of celebrity: Part three</title>
      <description>Hello wonderful humans!

Welcome to the final instalment of our Scientology series. For years, Katie Holmes was renowned as the passive, mild, third wife of Tom Cruise. Then, one day in 2012, she would prove the media wrong: the meek wife of the face of Scientology had been underestimated by just about everyone.

To watch that clip of Tom jumping up and down on Oprah’s couch, declaring his intense love for Katie, head here.

      <title>A rebuttal to the wellness warriors</title>
      <description>Hello! Happy Thursday!

This week, Zara recommended listening to ‘The Story of Simone Biles’ on The Daily. Mich recommended you follow @thehealchef on TikTok, as well as their interview with Jock Zonfrillo on The Books that Changed My Life, which you can find on the LiSTNR app.

      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0UUrSdqrilCxv1tHk4DYON?si=6c33bad6f1f648e1

Happy Saturday, friends!

This month we read ‘Malibu Rising’ by Taylor Jenkins Reid - the same author of our most popular book club pick yet, Daisy Jones and The Six. Malibu Rising follows four famous siblings as they throw an epic party to celebrate the end of summer in 1983. But over the course of twenty-four hours, their lives will change forever.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle talk all things characters, that chaotic Riva party, and the recurring generational patterns of family ties.

Grab a copy of next month’s book club pick, Fault Lines, via our affiliate link here.

Got some thoughts on our August pick, Fault Lines by Emily Itami? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to Libra for making this episode possible. If you want to give their new Period Proof Undies a go, head to your local Coles supermarket or right here. And don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at checkout for 20% off.

      <title>Tough titties, back home you go</title>
      <description>HEY BESTIES!

On today’s show: How many wedding dresses are too many dresses? Ange and Brad’s never-ending divorce hits another hurdle, the strangest kind-of-feud between Lisa Wilkinson and Khloe Kardashian, an investigation into whether J Lo and Ben Affleck are absolutely trolling us and then, finally, a conversation, in the wake of The Bachelor airing, about why we so rarely give reality stars the benefit for the doubt.

This week, Zara recommended Tom Daley’s interview with Desert Island Discs. Mich recommended, well, watching the Olympics. Ground breaking.

      <title>The cult of celebrity: Part one</title>
      <description>Goooood morning all!

It’s the church-meet-cult that’s famous for indoctrinating celebrities - Elisabeth Moss, John Travolta, and most notably, Tom Cruise. So, what the hell do we know about Scientology? And how does it have such a star-studded list of devotees?

Head here to read that LA Times piece on Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard, and here for Laura Prepon’s interview with Celebrity Magazine.

      <description>Happy Thursday mates!

On today’s show: Former Aussie Bachelorette Elly Miles is slammed for promoting a diet where you only eat meat, old mate Jeff Bezos popped on a cowboy hat and left the planet, a script has been leaked from the set of the new Sex and The City spinoff, and - finally - what the hell were Channel 7 and Big Brother thinking when it came to casting well-known bigot and troll Katie Hopkins?

This week, Zara recommended Line of Duty on Netflix. Mich recommended Luxe Listings Sydney on Amazon Prime.

      <title>Ah, the beauty of good PR</title>
      <description>Hellooooo friends!

On today’s show: Why Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian’s cosmetic brands (as we know them) are disappearing, almost overnight. Plus, Love Island is back, but is it doing enough to protect its contestants' mental health? And then, the bizarre story of Princess Charlene, Monaco’s runaway bride.

This week, Zara recommended two books: Fault Lines by Emily Itami and Sorrow and Bliss by Meg Mason. Mich recommended listening to the ‘Pieces of Britney’ podcast by Pandora Sykes and BBC Radio 4, and reading ‘Britney Spears’s Conservatorship Nightmare’ in the New Yorker by Ronan Farrow and Jia Tolentino.

For that clip of Princess Charlene crying at her wedding, head right here.

      <description>Good morning everyone!

Today, we’re heading back to 2014. When we watched Jay Z and Beyoncé walk the Met Gala in 2014, we saw a blissfully happy husband and wife. Only, when a black-and-white video leaked a week later, the public realised there had been a trick mirror all along.

Happy Saturday, book clubbers!

This month, we read the debut novel ‘New Animal’ by Australian author Ella Baxter. This book, set initially in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, then later in suburban Tasmania, follows the life of Amelia Aurelia; an embalmer who spends her days in funeral homes, painting the faces of the dead, and nights sleeping with strangers via the dating apps on her phone. More than anything, though, this is a novel of grief - by chapter four Amelia’s beloved mother dies by falling down the stairs, and the reader joins the protagonist as she wades through the all-consuming pain of loss.

Grab a copy of next month’s book club pick, Malibu Rising via our affiliate link here.

Got some thoughts on our July pick? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Big thanks to the legends over at CeraVe for making this episode possible. If you want to give their skincare a shot (especially as the days get colder and our skin gets drier!), check them out here.

      <description>Hi friends!

On today’s show: Kanye West has officially moved on from his marriage to Kim Kardashian, Megan Thee Stallion’s music video is equal parts mesmerising and traumatising, Chrissy Teigen would like to apologise, G Flip says they're a “gender smoothie” and THEN!!!! The Em Rata Instagram photo that caused such a stir, people can’t stop talking about it a week later.

This week, Zara recommended David Tennant’s podcast interview with Olivia Colman. Mich recommended listening to the Sentimental in the City podcast series by Sentimental Garbage.

      <title>Jen, Brad and Ange: Part two</title>
      <description>Happy Monday wonderful people!

Welcome to part two of our Jen, Brad and Ange series. Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt were Hollywood’s chosen two. Only, when Brad signed the dotted line to star in a movie called Mr. and Mrs. Smith, their public and personal lives would, quite literally, never look the same again.

Big thanks to Libra for making this episode possible. Check out their new Period Proof Undies right here or at Coles Supermarkets, and don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at the checkout for 20% off the Period Undies range.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Swing Time</title>

Happy Saturday, book clubbers!

This month, we tucked into Swing Time by Zadie Smith, a novel that tells the story of two girls growing up on the wrong side of London. They meet at a community dance class and dream of being dancers, but only one of them has the talent. The blurb told us it was a tale of “friendships that anchor us, define us and change us forever”, but do we feel that line adequately explained what the book was about? As with any Zadie Smith novel, this one came with hype: her clever observations, the depth of her characters, the nuance in her words. There is simply so. Much. To. Unpack.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle discuss Swing Time’s structure, the standout characters, and the bits in the book that didn’t quite land.

Grab a copy of next month’s book club pick, New Animal by Ella Baxter, via our affiliate link here.

      <title>An iconic throuple</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday legends!

On today’s show: A relatively unexpected celebrity throuple and why an interview with Princess Diana from 26 years ago is making headlines again. Plus, a history-making Bachelorette and why Billy Porter’s recent interview with the Hollywood Reporter is one of our favourite celebrity pieces in, well, a long time.

This week, Mich recommended watching Celebrity Apprentice Australia and listening to Olivia Rodrigo’s new album, SOUR. Zara recommended the podcast episode of Ladies, We Need To Talk called ‘The rage in my pelvis’.

If you want to offer help to those affected by the conflict in Gaza, SBS has a great round up here.

      <title>The life and death of Natalie Wood: Part one</title>
      <description>Hello friends!

Today, we’re heading back to the 1950s and ‘60s. Natalie Wood was an icon. Beautiful, talented, electric in front of a camera. And yet, for decades, public commentary has pertained mostly to her tragic - and confusing - death. How did a woman terrified of dark water die at sea?

Got some thoughts on this scandal you wanna share? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta @shamelesspodcast.

      <title>You can't just... throw a shoe at someone</title>
      <description>Hey pals! Happy Thursday!!!

Plus, another week, another Jen and Ben headline and CelebSpellcheck explains why they are back but not really back at all. Then, the story of Lea Michele throwing a shoe on the set of a mag shoot that sparked a conversation about what to do about stories of celebrities behaving badly.

This week, Zara recommended you listen to the episode of The Daily called ‘A Shrinking Society in Japan’. Mich re-recommended Zara’s rec from last week, The Sure Thing podcast.

      <title>“I’d rather die but thank you anyway"</title>
      <description>Good morning favourite people!

On today’s show: Victoria Beckham would, and we quote, “rather die” than wear some of Justin Bieber’s new Crocs and honestly, same. Plus, the fall and rise of an Aussie fitness queen, Kate and Will's PR team takes the approach of “more is better”, and *that* Billie Eilish Vogue cover - how the teen pop star is turning just about everything on its head.

This week, Mich recommended watching ‘Billie Eilish Answers Increasingly Personal Questions’ on Vanity Fair’s Youtube channel. Zara recommended the podcast, The Sure Thing.

Hiya! Happy Saturday!

This month, we tucked into the heart-shattering 2016 novel, It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover. It Ends With Us tells the story of an unusual love triangle between protagonist Lily, her first high school romance Atlas, and neurosurgeon Ryle. It’s a page-turning bestseller that explores the dynamics of physically abusive relationships, and how the cycle of violence needs to be broken despite the crushing heartbreak that inevitably flows.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle chat about whether or not the first half of the book landed for them, their favourite characters, and how the domestic violence storyline unfolded.

Got some thoughts on our April pick, It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover? We’re allllll ears (also, eyes, heads, bodies, etc etc) - join in the convo over on our Insta, @theshamelessbookclub. Or, if you’re after some variety, here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

      <title>Why are we so fascinated with 'botched' faces?</title>
      <description>Wassup friends!!!

On today’s show: Lizzo slides right into the DMs of Chris Evans and won’t stop sharing the screenshots with her followers. Plus, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker go from sucking each other’s thumbs to straddling in the desert and we have just a couple of questions. And then! The perfect influencer couple whose perfect life wasn’t actually all that perfect, and the photo of Zac Efron that has sparked many-a-plastic surgery conversations.

This week, Zara recommended the Old Boys Club podcast. Mich recommended watching Troye Sivan’s house tour with Architectural Digest.

On today’s show: Lizzo slides right into the DMs of Chris Evans and won’t stop sharing the screenshots with her followers. Plus, Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker go from sucking each other’s thumbs to straddling in the desert and we have just a couple of questions. And then! The perfect influencer couple whose perfect life wasn’t actually all that perfect, and the photo of Zac Efron that has sparked many-a-plastic surgery conversations.

This week, Zara recommended the Old Boys Club podcast. Mich recommended watching Troye Sivan’s house tour with Architectural Digest.

      <title>Whip out your breakup murals</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday fabulous people!

On today’s show: J-Lo and A-Rod’s heartbreak looks very different after announcing their split. Plus, Cody Simpson wants to boost the profile of… swimming… globally, we have some questions about SAS’s new lineup, and last but not least: how a prank about fairy bread exposed the biases of Australia’s biggest media publications.

This week, Mich defaulted her recommendation to Producer Annabelle, who recommended watching the movie Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom on Netflix. Zara recommended the 5-2-1 system! Listen to find out what on earth she’s talking about!

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Tarang Chawla</title>
      <description>Gah, it’s our last In Conversation episode for a little while!!! And what a show we have for you today.

Tarang Chawla is an Indian-born Australian lawyer, writer and anti-family violence advocate. In 2015, Tarang’s younger sister Nikita was murdered by her then-husband at the age of just 23. In the years since, Tarang has become one of the country’s leading campaigners for gender equality and advocates for women and children’s safety from family violence. In 2017, he was named a Young Australian of the Year finalist in Victoria and has written across topics including men's violence against women, discrimination, racism, masculinity and human rights.

After discussions with Tarang, Shameless Media has made the decision to donate $500 to Djirra to support Aboriginal women experiencing violence, as well as a further $500 to Dhadjowa Foundation, stopping black deaths in custody.

For more from Tarang, follow him on Instagram at @tarangchawla.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, CeraVe. Register for their Skin Chat panel’s discussion about Australian women’s facial skincare routines at www.ceraveskinchat.com.au.

      <title>Will you be my Byron bae?</title>
      <description>Gooooood morning all!

On today’s show: What do we make of the rumour that Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick… kind of hated each other? The Aussie influencer who’s the first person to be officially slapped on the wrist by an advertising standards board, Taylor Swift’s fresh album brings about fresh questions on her past, and - last but not least - the Byron Baes: Netflix has snapped up a reality show about Australia’s celebrity capital. So, will we be tuning in?

This week, Zara recommended watching Dancing with the Stars on Channel 7 and the book, The Good Sister by Sally Hepworth. Mich recommended Formula 1: Drive to Survive on Netflix.

Watch the TikTok videos by @celebritymemoirbookclub about the Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively feud right here.

Head here for Shareena Clanton’s statement about her experiences of racism on the set of Neighbours, and here for Sharon Johal’s.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Mari Andrew</title>
      <description>A very happy Monday to you, Shameless frens!

Today on the show, we bring you the incredibly warm Mari Andrew. If you don’t recognise Mari’s name, which you likely do anyway, you’ll no doubt know and adore the illustrations she posts on her Instagram account @bymariandrew. In 2015 after her father passed away, Mari began posting a watercoloured illustration a day onto her Instagram page, as a way to express grief, yes, but to also spread light. Now, Mari boasts over one million Instagram followers and is a New York Times best-selling author too, who has published two books, Am I There Yet and My Inner Sky - the latter of which she wrote while recovering from an unexpected illness that left her paralysed for an entire month while living in Spain.

In this chat with Mari, we talk about why she’s so unafraid to harness loneliness, her relationship with grief, and how she manages to write deeply private stories for her public audience without unleashing past trauma.

For more from Mari, follow her on Instagram at @bymariandrew. And to grab a copy of her book, My Inner Sky, head here. If you enjoyed this interview, we recommend you listen to our In Conversation episode with Zoë Foster Blake here, who Mari has created a lot of book illustrations for.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Sweaty Betty. Check out their new high-waisted power leggings here, and don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout for 20% off your entire order.

If this is your first time checking us out (hey, you), we are an independent media company that is dedicated to telling young women’s stories. The best way to support Shameless is to click ‘Follow’ on your Spotify app, and to tell your mates about us. We will reward such good behaviour with a puppy! Not everything in this paragraph is true!

To catch up on everything Shameless, head to our website www.shamelessmediaco.com.

We cherish your feedback on the show, and would bloody love to hear your wonderful voices. If you’d like to weigh in on an episode - whether it be a segment in our Thursday pop culture analysis, an In Conversation guest, or this month’s book club pick, we’d love for you to call our Shameless Hotline.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Yumiko Kadota</title>
      <description>Gooooood morning, wonderful listeners!

Today on the show, we bring you the brave Yumiko Kadota. Yumiko, as you’d read in her new memoir Emotional Female, has been an over-achiever her entire life, studying medicine at university and deciding to enter the perilous surgical stream when specialising as a doctor. Only, it was when Yumiko found herself trying to become a surgeon that she encountered the true, brutal nature of Australia’s hospital culture. Yumiko was subjected to such a ridiculous work schedule, colleagues who were unflinching in their coldness, and institutionalised sexism and racism that she was pushed to a mental breakdown in her late twenties, prompting her to take extended leave from her career and spend time as an inpatient in a psychiatric facility.

In this chat, we talk about the highs and the lows of being a female doctor in Australia, as well as what can be done to ensure the next generation of female surgeons aren’t pushed to a place they can’t come back from.

For more from Yumiko, follow her on Instagram at @mindbodymiko. And to grab a copy of her book, Emotional Female, head here.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Quay Australia. Head here to use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at checkout for 20% off.

      <description>Hey pals!

On today’s show: What the hell - literally - is going on with Lil Nas X right now, and why is he courting so much controversy this week? Then, why influencer’s mirror selfies are a big fat lie, Married At First Sight sparks important conversations about abusive relationships, and how one of Australia’s most iconic fashion brands, The Daily Edited, found itself in a bit of a PR debacle this week.

This week, Zara recommended watching Exposed: The Ghost Train on ABC iView. Mich recommended season 20 of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

      <itunes:summary>Hey pals!

On today’s show: What the hell - literally - is going on with Lil Nas X right now, and why is he courting so much controversy this week? Then, why influencer’s mirror selfies are a big fat lie, Married At First Sight sparks important conversations about abusive relationships, and how one of Australia’s most iconic fashion brands, The Daily Edited, found itself in a bit of a PR debacle this week.

This week, Zara recommended watching Exposed: The Ghost Train on ABC iView. Mich recommended season 20 of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Joel Creasey</title>
      <description>Hiya! Happy Monday!

Today on the show, we bring you the effervescent Joel Creasey. Joel is best known as one of the country’s leading stand-up comedians, having begun performing at the age of just 16. He’s performed everywhere from the Melbourne International Comedy Festival to the New York International Fringe Festival and the Edinburgh Fringe. But beyond comedy, Joel is also an author, an actor, and TV presenter who, after a stint on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here, became one of our most recognisable faces on television. But it was in 2020 when Joel got the call up to join Australia’s #1 drive program, replacing Marty Sheargold on Kate, Tim, and Marty.

For more from Joel, follow him on Instagram at @joelcreasey. If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend you listen to our interviews with fellow comedians Celia Pacquola or Matt Okine.

To grab tickets to Joel’s new show, Messy Bitch, head here.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: The Shadow Box</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7DE63ZzOef240bv3X3sJjj?si=1e64f004df3e4948

Halloooooo, fellow book clubbers!

This month, we are looking at best-selling author Luanne Rice’s pacey thriller, The Shadow Box. This book jumps before and after the day artist Claire Chase was brutally attacked, to explain just what happened to her. Claire survives before going into hiding and has her suspicions on who her attacker likely was - her admired husband and state attorney, Griffin Chase, who is also running for governor. On the day of Claire’s attack, she was about to launch a shadow box at her art exhibition, inspired by an unforgivable act she was convinced her husband was responsible for years ago. On that same day, one of Claire’s neighbours was also killed. Throughout this novel, as both investigations unfold, we learn exactly how both incidents overlap, and the extent of Griffin Chase’s power over the circle that surrounds him.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle ask allllll ze questions: Did Rice’s thriller keep us on our toes? What did we love about the book? And finally, were we satisfied with the ending?

Plus, Orlando Bloom is getting roasted online for his morning routine, Celeb Spell Check all but disappears from Instagram, the Hembrows are getting a reality show and then!!! Demi Lovato bares so much of her trauma - including what led to her 2018 overdose - for a new documentary.

This week, Zara recommended listening to the interview with Will McMahon on The Imperfects. Mich recommended this four-part deep dive on Jessica Simpson from the podcast, You’re Wrong About.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Chantelle Otten</title>
      <description>HELLOOO EVERYONE!

Today on the show, we bring you the serene Chantelle Otten. Chantelle is best known as one of the countries leading psycho-sexologists who works out of Melbourne with a team of more than 20. To put it simply, Chantelle is the authority on sex, not just for Australian women, but for Australians from all walks of life. She has built an incredibly successful career being one of the leading voices shattering taboos around sex: about what the average sex life should look like, about how common painful sex is, and about how sex can be pleasurable, no matter what body you live in.

In this chat, we covered everything: from why we are sold myths about sex from the moment we understand what it is, about how isolating sex can be if you feel like you’re doing it wrong, and why it’s important for her to be vocal about her own sex life with her Paralympian star boyfriend, Dylan Alcott.

For more from Chantelle, follow her on Instagram at @chantelle_otten_sexologist. If you enjoyed this chat, last year we sat down with Dylan Alcott and heard all about his life in professional sport - head here to listen.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, CeraVe. Check out their skincare right here.

      <title>The influencer circle of life</title>
      <description>Oh haaaiiii! Happy Thursday!

On today’s show: Bec Judd’s op shop donation causes an influencer storm, J-Lo’s engagement is on, then off, then on again, and the slut-shaming of Melbourne socialite Mia Fevola. Finally - last but not least - a chat about the Grammys and what the performance line-up told us about the legacy of music’s bad boy, John Mayer.

This week, Zara got a Kindle and hates it! So, she recommended you give her tips on how to enjoy using hers! Mich recommended watching ‘Making Their Mark’ on Amazon Prime.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Priyanka Chopra Jonas</title>
      <description>GOOD MORNING LISTENER FRIENDS!!!!

Today on the show, we bring you the most famous person we’ve ever had the privilege of interviewing on this podcast, Priyanka Chopra Jonas. Priyanka has more than 60 million followers on Instagram, is one of the biggest Bollywood actors and producers of her generation, has managed to pull off a seamless transition into Hollywood, is married to a Jonas brother, and just published a New York Times best-selling memoir. As you can imagine, getting to where Priyanka is today took boundless grit and guts and determination, but what we wanted to hear most from Priyanka was about the facets of her life that the lights and cameras don’t catch; the Priyanka who loves and hurts and feels the exact same range of emotions you or I do.

In this chat, we speak about Priyanka’s rise to the very top, yes, but also the village of people who got her there. We talk about grieving her father, grappling with loneliness, wrangling with fame, and falling in love with her husband, Nick.

For more from Priyanka, follow her on Instagram at @priyankachopra.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Bed Threads. Head here to use the code ‘SHAMELESS10’ for 10% off your order, valid until 10th April 2021.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Grace Tame</title>
      <description>Good morning wonderful Shameless community.

Today on the show, we bring you the absolute force that is Grace Tame. When Grace was just 15 years old, she was repeatedly groomed and raped by a 58-year-old maths teacher who taught at her Tasmanian high school. While - after serving his jail sentence - her perpetrator was allowed to speak about his crimes with the media, Grace legally wasn’t: she was prevented by law from sharing her story with the world. So, she decided to do something about it. Together with journalist and activist Nina Funnell, they created the #LetHerSpeak Campaign, which sought to overturn gag laws in Tasmania, the Northern Territory, and, more recently, Victoria. Grace’s voice has been so powerful and so necessary in the space of law reform, that in January, she was named our 2021 Australian of the Year.

A content warning before you listen to today’s chat - in this episode we discuss issues regarding grooming, child sexual abuse, eating disorders, self-harm and suicide, and may be triggering for some listeners.

For more from Grace, follow her on Instagram @tamepunk.

We urge you to check out the work of Bravehearts, a child safety foundation dedicated to preventing child sexual assault and exploitation in Australia. Support them in any way you can via their website, bravehearts.org.au.

If you’d like to seek support or advice, Braveheart’s support line is 1800 272 831.

If this is your first time checking us out (hey, you), we are an independent media company that is dedicated to telling young women’s stories. The best way to support Shameless is to click ‘Follow’ on your Spotify app, and to tell your mates about us. We will reward such good behaviour with a puppy!

      <title>Even celebs have shitty boyfriends</title>
      <description>Hellooooo! Happy Thursday!!!!

On today’s show: Taylor Swift blasts Netflix to her 88 million followers, Hilaria and Alec Baldwin’s big baby mystery, the Married at First Sight “hotness ranking” challenge that made the reality show’s “experts” look more like evil masterminds, and life through the eyes of Billie Eilish - how the teen star’s rise to the top has been very different to those who have gone before her.

This week, Zara recommended HBO’s documentary miniseries, Allen v. Farrow. If you’re on the hunt for THE BEST JEANS EVER, Mich recommended these beauties from Zara (the store... not... the person).

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Pepsi Max and their Pepsi Max Taste Challenge. Tag @pepsimaxaus on Instagram with the hashtag #allittakesisasip to take part in the challenge.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Celeste Barber</title>
      <description>Happy Mondaaaaay everybody!

Today on the show, we bring you the remarkable Celeste Barber. We have no doubt you know precisely who Celeste is - she does have 10 million followers across Instagram and Facebook - but we’ll introduce her to you anyway. Celeste began her career as an actress, but over the last six years, has channeled her talent for making people think and laugh into a movement she calls ‘Challenge Accepted’. The premise is simple and brilliant; via her Instagram page, Celeste parodies the content Instagram has become synonymous for - exceedingly thin, obscenely famous women posing in unrealistic and sometimes downright bizarre ways. Celeste’s comedy has made her a local and international sensation: she’s graced the likes of In Style Magazine, penned a best-selling memoir, is the new face of MCoBeauty, and is practically taking over the world, one post at a time.

In this chat, we wanted to hear about Celeste’s life before fame, the awkward stages of pursuing a career in the public eye, her relationship with rejection and failure, and what it’s like to build a business off the back of being yourself.

For more from Celeste, follow her on Instagram at @celestebarber and check out her podcast, Celeste and Her Best. If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend you listen to our chat with fellow comedian Celia Pacquola.

G’day book club friends!!!

This month, we read best-selling author Nick Hornby’s eighth novel, Just Like You. The book follows two protagonists, 22-year-old Joseph and 42-year-old Lucy, who fall in love despite coming from two different worlds. Joseph is a young Black DJ trying to find his place in the world, while Lucy is a white English teacher and mum of two, who has recently separated from her addict ex-husband. This isn’t just the story of a juicy love affair though: after all, the book is set in 2016 and Brexit is the backdrop of their union, meaning conversations about politics and race relations are littered throughout.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle talk about it all: Did Nick Hornby pull off his eighth book? Can a white man write about the experience of a Black man? And, were we pulled towards the romance of Lucy and Joseph?

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Bridget Malcolm</title>
      <description>Helloooooo pals!

Today on the show, we bring you the brilliant Bridget Malcolm. Bridget is a classically-trained musician, best known as an international model who walked for Victoria’s Secret in their 2015 and 2016 fashion shows, as well as walking for brands like Ralph Lauren and Stella McCartney. But Bridget’s story in the fashion industry isn’t just one of glitzy catwalks and endless travel. Instead, Bridget spent much of her early and prominent years modelling battling a relentless eating disorder which, for two years, saw her live off little more than protein shakes and steamed vegetables.

In this chat, we talk about all of it: her lowest moments, her love of music, her complicated relationship with alcohol, her relatively recent diagnosis of Pre Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder, and how she feels about the modelling industry after everything she’s been through.

If this chat raises issues for you, support is available on The Butterfly Foundation's National Support Line, 1800 33 4673.

For more from Bridget, follow her on Instagram @bridgetmalcolm and subscribe to her new podcast, Model Mentality on Spotify here.

If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend you listen to our chat with model and entrepreneur Steph Claire Smith, which you can find here.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Maybelline New York and their Instant Age Rewind Concealer. Head here to check it out.

      <title>Prying paps and tricky tabloids</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday legends!!!

On today’s show: Scott Disick is dating… yep, another teenager. Then, Justin Timberlake’s apology, an Aussie magazine’s huge Meghan and Harry blunder, and finally, a big bumper discussion about the Bondi paparazzi: How Aussie tabloids and their seedy photographers are slowly - and insidiously - influencing the way you think about women in the public eye.

This week, Mich recommended checking out your nearest plant delivery service, and Zara recommended watching the movie Holding The Man, which you can find on Netflix or Stan.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Martha Kalifatidis</title>
      <description>Happy Monday folks!

Today on the show, we bring you the vibrant Martha Kalifatidis. You’re likely familiar with the makeup artist and reality star after she appeared in one of the country’s most-watched seasons of Married at First Sight. Yes, she may well be known for a certain **wine throwing** incident, but she also left the show with a huge and fiercely loyal group of fans who fell in love with how confident, unapologetic, and yes - if we may use a buzzword to round this list out - authentic she really is. Oh, and they fell in love with her love story too, after Martha and her Married at First Sight husband Michael defied the reality TV odds, still together more than two years after the show aired.

In this chat, we talked about why she decided to go on the show, the dark days she spent in bed when trolling got too much and how Michael changed her life completely.

For more from Martha, follow her on Instagram @marthaa__k.

If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend you also listen to our chats with Love Island’s Tayla Damir and The Bachelor’s Abbie Chatfield.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, CeraVe. Head here to check out their incredible skincare.

      <description>HELLO, LOVELY LISTENERS!

On today’s show: Australia has its own local and modern-day gossip girl - Celeb Spellcheck - so what happens when influencers are determined to track her down and expose her identity? Plus, Kim Kardashian West thinks her seven-year-old daughter North is Picasso, why the Golden Globes are more irrelevant than ever, and then, why Janet Jackson was trending on Monday, some 17 years after the term ‘nipplegate’ entered the zeitgeist.

This week, Mich recommended the new documentary, Framing Britney Spears, and Zara recommended watching The Undoing.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Maybelline New York and their Fit Me foundation. Head here to check it out.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Yassmin Abdel-Magied</title>
      <description>HEY FRIENDS!

Today on the show, we bring you the whip-smart Yassmin Abdel-Magied. Yassmin is a media personality and a writer, yes, but she’s also a woman who worked for years as a successful engineer and social justice advocate who, at just 16, started the youth charity Youth Without Borders. In 2010 she was named Young Queenslander of the year, and in 2015, she was named Queensland Australian of the Year. Her 2014 TED Talk has been watched by more than 3 million people worldwide, she’s written a memoir, and now she’s turning her hand to YA fiction, releasing You Must Be Layla in 2019, and her newest book, Listen, Layla, which was released this week.

In this chat, we talk about everything: from being a teenage overachiever, to the precipice of burnout, to what it feels like to grieve her younger self.

For more from Yassmin, follow her on Instagram @yassmin_a and grab a copy of her latest novel, Listen, Layla.

If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend you also listen to our chat with fellow writer Jamila Rizvi. You can find that one right here.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Quay. Head here to check out their awesome sunnies.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Bonny Rebecca</title>
      <description>HIYA FRIENDS!

Today on the show, we bring you the ever-so-sweet Bonny Rebecca. For the unacquainted, Bonny Rebecca is a content creator and influencer with one hell of a story to tell. In 2018, at the height of the plant-based Instagram movement, Bonny - someone who had built a life and a career based on the lifestyle - decided to tell the world that she was leaving veganism for good. Cue: total internet outrage. Outrage so bad that Bonny found her name and face in massive publications like VICE.

In this chat, we asked Bonny: What’s it like to find yourself in the eye of a social media storm? Is that corner of the internet really a bit like a cult? And how do you find yourself again when everything you once defined yourself as comes crashing down?

For more from Bonny, follow her on Instagram @bonnyrebecca.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Style by Deni</title>
      <description>A very happy Monday to you, wonderful friends!

Today on the show, we bring you the electric Deni Todorovic. You may well know Deni by their moniker, Style by Deni - a nod to their successful career as a fashion editor at Cosmopolitan Magazine and now GT magazine, and work as a celebrity stylist.

In this chat, we go everywhere: from the moment as a kid they knew they were different, to working in the magazine industry as it was slowly dying, to coming to grips with their own gender identity.

For more from Deni, follow them on Instagram @stylebydeni.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Somersby Mango &amp; Lime. Head here to find out more.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Tayla Damir</title>
      <description>We're baaaaaack and BOY is this a goodie to officially kick off 2021!

Today on the show, we bring you the delightful Tayla Damir. You may know Tayla from her time on Love Island season one where she fell in love, won the reality show, and promptly found out her boyfriend - the one she won beside - actually had a girlfriend on the outside the entire time. Now, with an Instagram following of more than half a million people, Tayla Damir has proven to be so much more than her Island experience and the drama that ensued in the weeks after.

In this chat, we talk about the sugary stuff like, how does one even find themselves applying for the show? And how did she find out Grant Crapp actually had a girlfriend sitting at home? But also, we go deeper into Tayla’s struggles with her mental health and why her first business venture is something so close to her heart.

For more from Tayla, follow her on Instagram @tayla.damir. If you enjoyed this episode, may we also recommend you listen to our In Conversation chats with Bella Varelis and Brooke Blurton.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Samantha Wills</title>
      <description>Goooood morning, everyone! HAPPY LAST DAY OF 2020!

Today on the show, we bring you the formidable Samantha Wills. You likely know Samantha’s name from her eponymous jewelry line, Samantha Wills. Back in 2004, Sam decided to invest her last $500 to showcase her jewelry - jewelry she was then selling at the Bondi markets at Australian Fashion Week. People fell in love, and very soon, she was overwhelmed with orders. Three years in though - despite boasting a successful and very popular business - Sam found herself $70,000 in debt. So, how did she turn it all around? And why did she decide to close, rather than sell, a 10 million dollar business?

In this chat, we go everywhere, from burnout to chronic illness to broken relationships to business.

For more from Samantha, follow her on Instagram @samanthawills. If you enjoyed this episode, may we also recommend you listen to our In Conversation chats with Kylie Brown and Michelle Battersby.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Bioré. Check out their new Brightening Collection here.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Transcendent Kingdom</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/0D39Y5QgX53l9PngQlT7AS?si=239a0943f6854fef

OHHH, it's the last book club for 2020, friends!

This month, we read Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi - a novel that centres around Gifty, a neuroscientist at Stanford who studies addiction and depression neural circuits through experimenting with mice. This, we come to learn, is no coincidence. Transcendent Kingdom deals with grief, mental illness, and religion, and also takes us back through Gifty’s life: From her brother’s opioid addiction to a disappearing father to being sent to Ghana to live with her Aunt while her mother battles depression at home.

Transcendent Kingdom was a NYT bestseller and is Yaa Jessie’s second published work. Mich sat down for an interview with Yaa about her novel, which we will play in the second half of this episode.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Penguin Books Australia and The Push by Audrey Audrain. Head here to buy a copy.

If you’d like to share your thoughts on our January pick, ‘Daisy Jones and The Six’ by Taylor Jenkins Reid, record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com). Or, if you’re after some variety ,here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

Grab yourself a copy of ‘Daisy Jones and The Six’ and join our convo next month! We’d love to have you!  Head here to purchase it.

To catch up on everything Shameless, head to our website www.shamelessthepodcast.com.

Shameless Podcast is run by three women in their twenties, and thrives on the support of our incredible listeners - that's you! So, if you’d like to support the show, we would like that very much. Hit ‘follow’ on Spotify, and leave a review if you’re feeling especially generous. Then sit back and bask in our eternal, abundant love.

      <description>Happy Monday wonderful people!

Plus, Johnny Depp’s celeb-laden love life is outed as part of his court case against Amber Heard, Taylor Swift outdoes herself by releasing her second album in 2020, and - last but not least- the Red Table Talk that sparked a huge discussion about star power and privilege.

This week, Zara recommended the episode of The Cut, ‘Would You Move Back Home? Could You?’. Mich recommended the gorgeous art and v handy pre-framed section from Society6.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Kylie Brown</title>
      <description>Hey, legends!

Today on the show, we bring you the formidable Kylie Brown. Kylie is in the public eye, partly, because her husband Jonathan Brown is a well-known former AFL star and radio personality. But it’s what Kylie has managed to do with her profile and platform that has blown us away. After struggling with chronic endometriosis for two decades, and undergoing no less than nine surgeries - including a hysterectomy at 34 - to manage her condition, Kylie opened an Instagram account to track her journey and spread awareness about endo.

In this chat, we talk about Kylie’s battle with her body so far, and why she decided to run a marathon when the odds were well and truly stacked against her.

For more from Kylie, follow her on Instagram at @endo.runner. If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend you check out our chat with fellow endo warrior Bridget Hustwaite.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Vodka Soda &amp; and their new Pink Gin Soda &amp;. For their ‘special pack’ deal, check out the link in their instagram bio @ginsodaand or find their products in-store.

If this is your first time checking us out (hey, you), we are an independent media company that is dedicated to telling young women’s stories.

      <title>BOOK CLUB: Ghosts</title>
      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/5PwGumOnjhUbz2vNtWkQdS?si=90750de4c18e40ec

A very happy Saturday to you, book club friends!!!

This month, we’re delving into bestselling author Dolly Alderton’s fiction debut: the warm, funny, tender novel, Ghosts. Ghosts tells the story of food writer Nina Dean who enters her thirties with a successful career under her belt and strong friendships around her. And then, well... then she meets Max - a tall, clever, evasive man who told her on their first date that he will marry her. She loves him, he loves her. For five months, they’re entwined in each other’s lives and then he just… disappears. Ghosts tells the story of how friendship changes over the decades and how terminal illness in a family can sometimes splinter the relationships of those who are hurting. Just over a month after release, Ghosts is already a Sunday Times bestselling novel.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle discuss the hype around this book, the magnificent character that is Lola, and the plot lines that didn’t quite land (we’re looking at you, Angelo).

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Penguin Books Australia and The Last Migration by Charlotte McConaghy. Head here to pick up a copy.

If you’d like to share your thoughts on our December pick, ‘Transcendent Kingdom’ by Yaa Gyasi, record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com). Or, if you’re after some variety,here’s a link to record a voice message via our website, too.

And then, well... then she meets Max - a tall, clever, evasive man who told her on their first date that he will marry her. She loves him, he loves her. For five months, they’re entwined in each other’s lives and then he just… disappears. Ghosts tells the story of how friendship changes over the decades and how terminal illness in a family can sometimes splinter the relationships of those who are hurting. Just over a month after release, Ghosts is already a Sunday Times bestselling novel.</p><p><br></p><p>Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle discuss the hype around this book, the magnificent character that is Lola, and the plot lines that didn’t quite land (we’re looking at you, Angelo).</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, <a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/the-last-migration-9781760893316">Penguin Books Australia and The Last Migration by Charlotte McConaghy</a>.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: The Inspired Unemployed</title>
      <description>HIYA FRIENDS!

Today, we bring you the men behind The Inspired Unemployed, Matt Ford and Jack Steele. Matt and Jack have gone from relative obscurity to being an internationally-recognised duo in only the last year or so. They have accumulated 600,000 followers on TikTok and nearly 800,000 on Instagram, and have also fronted campaigns for Fendi, The Iconic, and Louis Vuitton.

In this chat, we talk about the transition from working on suburban job sites as tradies to starring on the cover of GQ, as well as how they keep having fun when their side hustle has now become their full-time job.

For more from The Inspired Unemployed, follow them on Instagram @theinspiredunemployed.

If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend checking out our chats with Hamish Blake and Andy Lee.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Florence Given</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday everybody!!!

Today, we bring you the enigmatic Florence Given. For the unacquainted, Florence is nothing short of a force to be reckoned with. The 21-year-old feminist illustrator, writer, and activist released her debut book, Women Don’t Owe You Pretty, in June this year, and has gone on to become a number one Sunday Times bestseller. Florence now has a social media following of more than half a million people, and has single-handedly carved out one of the most engaged spaces for the queer community online.

In this chat, we go from Florence’s turbulent high school experience, to what she would change about social media if she was given a chance.

For more from Florence, follow her on Instagram @florencegiven, and grab a copy of her incredible book, Women Don’t Owe You Pretty, right here.

If you enjoyed this episode, we recommend checking out our chats with Clementine Ford and Jameela Jamil.

This week, Zara recommended The Rise Of The Murdoch Dynasty on ABC iView. Off the back of last week’s Christmas movie chat, Mich recommended the show A Moody Christmas.

Here’s the GQ profile on Carl Lentz that Zara mentioned in this episode.

      <description>HELLO LISTENER FRIENDS!

On today’s show: The explosive Bachelorette finale that took us by surprise after quite a lacklustre season. Plus, the baby rumours that Hailey Bieber is having none of, and then, how one of Netflix’s most-streamed films in 2020 also happens to be one of the worst Christmas movies we’ve ever seen.

This week, Mich and Zara recommended some top-quality/kinda niche Christmas movies you should spend your time watching instead of Holidate - While You Were Sleeping and Home Alone Four.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Sophie Delezio</title>
      <description>Hiiiii lovely people!

Today, we bring you the remarkable Sophie Delezio. If Sophie’s name sounds familiar, you were probably first introduced to her story more than 16 years ago, when a car crashed into Sophie’s daycare centre and trapped Sophie underneath. In that incident, she suffered burns to more than 85% of her body, lost both of her feet, a number of fingers, and an ear. A few years later, Sophie’s life was threatened again by a serious car accident, where, after being thrown from her wheelchair, she obtained an acquired brain injury. In the face of so much adversity, Sophie Delezio is a sunshine-y force to be reckoned with. Now, on the cusp of her twenties, Sophie is a fighter who didn’t just survive, but thrived despite everything that life threw at her.

In this chat we will retrace the two events that shaped Sophie into the incredible person she is today, and how her parents’ and brother’s love nurtured her in even the darkest of moments.

For more from Sophie, follow her on Instagram @soph.delezio. If you liked this episode, we recommend checking out our chat with skydiving accident survivor Em Carey, which you can find here.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Lo Bros Kombucha. Keep an eye out on our Instagram page for your chance to win enough Lo Bros Cola Kombucha to last you an entire summer.

      <title>The great birthday party divide</title>
      <description>Hey there!

On today’s show: Is James Corden the next to fall down to cancel culture? Plus, the celebrity baby boom, David Beckham’s massive Netflix’s deal, and the Kardashian birthday story that split Shameless listeners right down the middle. Is it a bit gross to celebrate your 40th birthday on a private island and post about it on social media, all in the midst of a pandemic? Or, should we just accept that rich people are going to live their very best lives, no matter what the rest of us are doing?

This week, Mich recommended Reputation Rehab on ABC iView. For our fellow Melbournians, Zara recommended listening out for the boisterous noises of lively pubs, restaurants, and busy roads. We’ve missed you, sounds!

HEY THERE BOOK CLUB FRIENDS!

This month, we’re talking all about the critically acclaimed, worldwide bestseller from Swedish columnist and blogger Fredrik Backman - A Man Called Ove. Ove is the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. He’s also deep in the grips of grief after losing his beloved wife, Sonja. He doesn’t know it yet, but when a boisterous young family moves in next door, his life is about to change. A Man Called Ove was published in English in 2014 and has sold more than 2.8 million copies internationally. In 2015 it was even made into a movie.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle break down why this book made them chuckle and cry in equal measure, as well as the standout characters and main takeaways from the book.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, JustCo. Register for a trial or book a virtual tour here.

      <title>Oystergate</title>
      <description>Happy Monday lovely people!

On today’s show: The influencer who reportedly held up a Jetstar flight because she was busy shucking oysters, an examination of Blake Lively’s very confusing shoes, and then, a discussion on that scene in the new Borat movie. Finally, we do a deep dive on the most talked-about story of the week: Bec Judd’s now-infamous 'Free Melbourne' t-shirt.

This week, Zara recommended the movie ‘Brexit: The Uncivil War’ on Stan. Mich recommended watching ‘Borat Subsequent Moviefilm’ on Amazon Prime.

      <description>Haaaaappy Thursday friends!

Today, we bring you the wonderful AJ Clementine. AJ is an influencer and content creator, well known for her LGBTQI advocacy, sense of style, and bright personality.

Now 24, she is the first transgender person to model for a Bonds campaign, has walked the runway at VAMFF, and cemented herself as a leading voice for young Australians with over 100,000 followers on Instagram.

In this chat, AJ talks candidly about her high school experience, as well as finding love when she least expected to.

If you’d like more from AJ, follow her on Instagram @ajclementine_. Enjoyed this chat with AJ? We think you’ll also love our chats with fellow creatives Jules Von Hep and Courtney Act.

      <title>The (most meta) affair</title>
      <description>Hellooooo wonderful people!

On today’s show: The Dominic West and Lily James affair we never could have predicted but care so very much about. Plus, Cardi B and Offset are back together AGAIN, Billie Eilish is trolled for having... a body... and then, why everyone cannot stop talking about Netflix’s, Emily In Paris.

This week, Zara recommended The Comey Rule on Stan. She also recommended mixing up your washing powder! Don’t knock it ‘til you try it! Mich recommended watching Junior Masterchef on Network Ten.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Dolly Alderton</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, Shameless pals!

Today, we bring you the electric Dolly Alderton. Dolly is a British columnist, author and podcaster, best known as the co-host of the widely popular current affairs podcast, The High Low. She is also the author of the bestselling memoir, Everything I Know About Love, but is now trying her hand at fiction, on the cusp of releasing her very first novel, Ghosts.

In this chat, Dolly explains what it's like to have half a million people know about her life - both the good parts and the ugly - in her twenties, and why she's so determined to protect her private life in her thirties.

If you’d like more from Dolly, grab her debut novel, Ghosts, here.

Enjoyed this chat? Well, we think you’ll also love our interview with Dolly's podcast co-host, Pandora Sykes.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Somersby Sparkling Selections. Head here to check it out.

      <title>The one where The Daily Mail breaks us</title>
      <description>HAPPY MONDAY FRIENDS!!!

On today’s show: The Fleetwood Mac and cranberry juice TikTok that has exploded online. Then, The Bachelorette’s relevancy problem and what to make of the rumours that Naya Rivera’s ex-husband and sister have become romantically linked in the wake of her death. And finally, two Daily Mail stories were published on the weekend that epitomise absolutely everything grotesquely wrong with the publication.

This week, Zara recommended listening to our upcoming In Conversation episode with (incoming clickbait!) a British writer we so admire. Mich recommended getting all your important, routine health check ups, as well as reminding your loved ones to do the same. She also suggested watching the David Attenborough documentary, A Life On Our Planet.

      <itunes:summary>HAPPY MONDAY FRIENDS!!!

On today’s show: The Fleetwood Mac and cranberry juice TikTok that has exploded online. Then, The Bachelorette’s relevancy problem and what to make of the rumours that Naya Rivera’s ex-husband and sister have become romantically linked in the wake of her death. And finally, two Daily Mail stories were published on the weekend that epitomise absolutely everything grotesquely wrong with the publication.

This week, Zara recommended listening to our upcoming In Conversation episode with (incoming clickbait!) a British writer we so admire. Mich recommended getting all your important, routine health check ups, as well as reminding your loved ones to do the same. She also suggested watching the David Attenborough documentary, A Life On Our Planet.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Cole Brown</title>
      <description>Why hello there, listener friends!

Today, we bring you the very clever Cole Brown. Cole is a twenty-five-year-old author and writer who has just published his first critically acclaimed book, Greyboy. It’s a series of essays written about life at the intersection of class and race, where in it, Cole shares so many valuable personal insights on white privilege, racism, and black identity.

In this chat, Cole talks about what it’s like growing up black in America when you don’t quite fit the stereotype of what the world tells you being black looks like. And then, how Cole feels sharing his most personal trauma with the masses, as well as his thoughts on the upcoming U.S. election.

If you’d like more from Cole, do yourself a favour and grab his debut book, ‘Greyboy: Finding Blackness in a White World’, here. Enjoyed this chat with Cole? Well, we think you’ll also love our interviews with Jennifer Atilemile and Georgie Dent.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Somersby Sparkling Selections. Head here to check it out.

      <description>Happy Monday pals!

On today’s show: What is ‘Surge Capacity’ and why are people like Brené Brown talking so much about it? Plus, Kylie Jenner dresses daughter Stormi in a $16,000 backpack. And then, Chrissy Teigen and John Legend’s harrowing loss.

**Just a warning before listening to this episode: Our final segment discusses pregnancy loss and bereavement, and may be triggering for some listeners. If you need, reach out for support from SANDS here.**

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Bella Varelis</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday, Shameless fam!

Today, we bring you the lovely Bella Varelis. Whether you’re a fan of The Bachelor franchise or not, you’ll likely know Bella’s name after its finale aired last Thursday, when Locky told Bella and this season’s winner, Irena, that he loved them both.

In this chat, we ask Bella about it all: From what compelled her to apply for The Bachelor, to the friendships she made and lost on the show, and the relentless online abuse she’s been receiving these past few months.

If you’d like more from Bella, follow her on Instagram at @bellavarelis. Enjoyed this chat with Bella? Well, we think you’ll love our interviews with fellow Bachie alumni, Alisha Aitken-Radburn and Brooke Blurton.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Dan Murphy’s. Find out more about their new Seltzers range here.

If this is your first time checking us out (hey, you), we are an independent media company that is dedicated to telling young women’s stories. The best way to support Shameless is to click ‘Subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘Follow’ on your Spotify app, and to tell your mates about us. We will reward such good behaviour with a puppy!

Hiiiiya pals!

This month, we’re talking all about Jessie Tu’s debut novel, A Lonely Girl Is A Dangerous Thing. It’s a novel about a young Taiwanese-Australian woman named Jena Lin, who - after being recognised as a prodigy throughout childhood - has re-introduced classical violin back into her life as a 20-something Syndey-sider. We see Jena navigate relationships of all kinds in this book, and how those relationships affect the way she views and treats herself. The novel explores themes like sex, power, desire, and of course, the loneliness Jena can’t quite shake.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara, and Annabelle discuss it all: From whether you need to like a main character to like a book, to those graphic sex scenes and mysterious, unresolved plotlines.

Check out the article Jessie Tu wrote for Primer that Zara mentioned in this episode here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Hamish Blake</title>
      <description>HELLO FRIENDS!

Today, we are joined by the incredible Hamish Blake - a comedian, writer, and one half of Australia’s most iconic radio and podcasting duos, Hamish and Andy. Hamish is Australia’s funniest person, yes, but he is so much more than that, too. Behind the scenes, he is such a supportive and kind person in the industry who is very generous with his time, a switched on business person, and, of course, a father of two.

In this chat, we explore the career failures that came his way in his twenties, his best friendship and chemistry with Andy Lee, and why fatherhood brings him so much joy and fulfilment.

You no doubt already are, but check out Hamish on Instagram at @hamishblakeshotz and listen to his podcast with Andy Lee here.

As for our In Conversation interview with TEN-TIME AUTHOR and Go-To Skincare founder (who also happens to be Hamish’s wife!) Zoë Foster Blake, head here.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Dan Murphy’s. Find out more about their new Seltzers range here.

If this is your first time checking us out (hey, you), we are an independent media company that is dedicated to telling young women’s stories. The best way to support Shameless is to click ‘Follow’ on your Spotify app, and to tell your mates about us. We will reward such good behaviour with a puppy!

      <title>You! Don't! Need! To! Like! The! Photo!</title>
      <description>Greetings, good people! Happy Monday!

On today’s show: We have some issues with the Instagram activity of this year’s bachelor, Locky Gilbert. Plus, how do we feel about J.K. Rowling’s books being removed from bookstore shelves in the wake of her transphobic statements? Then, a deep dive on model Emily Ratajkowski’s viral essay in New York Magazine’s The Cut this week, and an exploration of women’s bodies, the photographs of those bodies, and who actually owns them.

This week, Zara recommended listening to Ryan Shelton’s interview on The Imperfects, and Mich recommended watching the new documentary, Freeman, on ABC iView.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Dan Murphy’s and their new Seltzers range. Head here to find out more.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Jennifer Atilemile</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday lovely people!

Today on the show we have the formidable Jennifer Atilemile. Jennifer is an international model and writer who advocates for greater representation of racial and body diversity in the media, and who has very recently landed one of the biggest jobs of her career: A campaign with Victoria’s Secret. In this chat we cover everything from what she loves about the modelling industry, to why she feels every job she books is - in her own words - “a win for not just size diversity, but a win for the increase in racial and body diversity in advertising, too.” Jennifer is candid about the burnout that comes with being an activist in 2020, and how she feels about slacktivism online more than three months after the death of George Floyd made headlines across the world.

You can find more from Jennifer on Instagram here, or you can check out her new pod! Just search ‘Here if You Need’ in your favourite pod app.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Dan Murphy’s and their new Seltzer range.

Oh oh oh and in case you haven’t heard (lol) our book is FINALLY available and in all good bookstores! BUY THE SPACE BETWEEN HERE!

If you liked this chat, you may well enjoy our interviews with Jameela Jamil and Kate Wasley.

      <description>A happy, happy Monday to you all!

On today’s show: Zac Efron has a new Aussie girlfriend, and we’re sorry, but it’s not you. Plus, why the hell is Wayne Carey one of the country’s biggest faces on TV, and then, what does the cancellation of Keeping Up With The Kardashians say about the changing nature of celebrity?

This week, Mich recommended Concrete Jellyfish earrings, and Zara recommended Little Fires Everywhere on Amazon Prime.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Zara McDonald</title>
      <description>G’day, wonderful humans!

Last week, Zara interviewed Mich to celebrate the launch of their new book, The Space Between. Well, this week it’s Zara’s turn to be interviewed! Yay! Fun! Ok Less me (Annabelle, hey!) now, more them!

In this chat, Mich asks Zara about it all: From how it feels to find out both your parents are sick with cancer, to having fears of infertility, working through chronic illness, and breaking down the self-doubt that often arises when you’re in a job as public and personal as this one.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Calming Blankets. Use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ for $115 off your adult's or children’s Calming Blanket.

Oh oh oh and the book is FINALLY available and in all good bookstores! BUY THE SPACE BETWEEN HERE!

      <title>ATTN: Khloé Kardashian</title>
      <description>HALLOOOOO, WONDERFUL PEOPLE!

On today’s show: Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson are officially back together for the third time, and do we have any right to massively roll our eyes at that fact? Then, singer Adele runs - hair first - into a sea of controversy, and finally, how many friends do you need to be happy, and in 2020 is it possible to be best mates with someone whose world view differs so greatly from your own?

This week, Zara recommended listening/re-listening to this Spotify playlist Bridget Hustwaite made for Shameless and Mich recommended watching Selling Sunset on Netflix.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Michelle Andrews</title>
      <description>Hello! Surprise! It's Mich! In conversation!

You guys have been asking for us to interview each other for quite a while now and we figured there was no better opportunity to do exactly that than the two eps following our book launch.

In this chat, Zara asks Mich about the experience of her parents separating when she was in her early twenties, how she finds fulfilment in her work, and her final essay in The Space Between, where she generously shares a chapter of her life story that she's never told the world before.

If you or a loved one is struggling with the aftermath of sexual violence, please call 1800 RESPECT.

Zara would also like to ask that you don't DM Mich about anything shared in this episode and is very grateful for your understanding.

A big shoutout to today's sponsor, The Oodie! Get $30 off your v-comfy Oodie using the code SHAMELESS30 at checkout.

Oh oh oh and our book is FINALLY available and in all good bookstores! BUY THE SPACE BETWEEN HERE!

      <title>Beware the swarm of stans</title>
      <description>Hi everybody!!!!

On today’s show: How does Stan culture function in 2020, and why do so many celebrities struggle with valid critique? Then, Pete Evans and Magda Szubanski lock heads on celebrity-led COVID ads, and finally, we remember Chadwick Boseman - a star gone too soon who left an indelible mark on the world.

This week, Zara recommended this Caramilk pudding recipe. Mich recommended watching Suits if you haven’t already, which you can find on Netflix here.

      <description>Link to this episode in the new The Shameless Book Club feed: https://open.spotify.com/episode/1uqMITiWOWN4yR5Uz5ierO?si=043dae8ac94c478b

Correction: An earlier edit of this episode said the fictional town of Massacre Plains was based in the Northern Territory of Australia. This is incorrect - the town is based in New South Wales.

HELLOOOOO BOOK CLUB PALS!

This month, we’re discussing the 2020 Miles Franklin Literary Award winner, The Yield, by Tara June Winch. The novel tells the story of a woman who has returned home after the passing of her Poppy, Albert Gondiwindi, and felt like her life had passed her by ever since her sister, Jedda, vanished as a child. August’s perspective is interspersed with that of Albert, via his almost diary-like Wiradjuri dictionary entries, and a letter from 1915, written by the German reverend Ferdinand Greenleaf, who established a mission in Massacre Plains.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara and Annabelle talk about the characters they adored, the scenes most vivid for them, and the importance of the Wiradjuri language.

Correction: An earlier edit of this episode said the fictional town of Massacre Plains was based in the Northern Territory of Australia. This is incorrect - the town is based in New South Wales.

HELLOOOOO BOOK CLUB PALS!

This month, we’re discussing the 2020 Miles Franklin Literary Award winner, The Yield, by Tara June Winch. The novel tells the story of a woman who has returned home after the passing of her Poppy, Albert Gondiwindi, and felt like her life had passed her by ever since her sister, Jedda, vanished as a child. August’s perspective is interspersed with that of Albert, via his almost diary-like Wiradjuri dictionary entries, and a letter from 1915, written by the German reverend Ferdinand Greenleaf, who established a mission in Massacre Plains.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara and Annabelle talk about the characters they adored, the scenes most vivid for them, and the importance of the Wiradjuri language.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Jessica Nguyen</title>
      <description>HEY HEY! Happy Thursday!

Today on the show, we bring you our good friend and resident foodie, Jess Nguyen. Jess is a home cook and recipe creator who, after being made redundant from her job at Mecca in March this year, made herself the go-to source of delicious, easy-to-cook meals. It’s not even been six months since her redundancy, and Jess has already worked with brands like Vogue Australia to bring joy to her rapidly growing Instagram following of almost fifty thousand people.

In this chat, Jess tells us about the moment she learned she’d been made redundant from her job in public relations, to how food is her form of therapy, and why it’s been that way since childhood.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Medibank and their Live Better at Home program. Head here to find out more.

If you’d like to hear more from Jess, which you no doubt 1000% do, check out her Instagram @jessica_nguyen_. And for those other In Conversation interviews we mentioned at the end of today’s episode, click here for Melissa Leong and here for Cyan Ta'eed.

The best way to support Shameless is to click ‘Subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘Follow’ on your Spotify app, and to tell your mates about us. We will reward such good behaviour with a puppy!

      <title>Two women, thirteen years, a new narrative</title>
      <description>Happy Monday morning, absolute faves!

On today’s show: Does former Bachelorette Georgia Love have a right to complain about her wedding being cancelled for the second time? Plus, The Masked Singer Australia has been shutdown after seven crew members tested positive for COVID-19, and how do we feel about television shows being considered 'essential services'. Then, actress Olympia Valance had her intimate photos hacked from her phone and shared illegally online and the media coverage could not be more different compared to the headlines surrounding Vanessa Hudgens' photo leaks 13 years ago.

This week, Zara recommended the Call Your Girlfriend podcast episode, Shine Theory 101. Mich recommended The Daily’s two-part series on cancel culture. You can find part one here and part two here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Jameela Jamil</title>
      <description>IT’S A VERY HAPPY THURSDAY INDEED!!!!!

Today on the show, we bring the incredible Jameela Jamil (a woman who probably doesn’t need an introduction, but of course, we’ll give her one anyway). Jameela is a British actress, former radio host, writer, and activist who rose to global fame through her role as Tahani Al-Jamil on The Good Place. She is also the brainchild behind the I Weigh movement - a force of more than one million people who band together to challenge dangerous diet culture on platforms like Instagram.

In this chat, Jameela explains what it’s like going head-to-head with the Kardashians over laxative teas, as well as how she defines success.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Andalou Naturals. Head here to find out more.

If you’d like to hear more from Jameela, which you no doubt 1000% do, check out the I Weigh movement on Instagram @i_weigh. And for her podcast, I Weigh with Jameela Jamil, head here.

      <title>The hair rant that stopped the nation</title>
      <description>HI! HELLO! HOW ARE YA??!

On today’s show: The influencer who broke lockdown laws and was taken down by social media vigilantism. Then, is Rihanna planning total world domination? And finally, we go deep on the Bachelor season premiere and *that* red hair rant.

This week, Zara recommended the Bloody Floradora cocktail. Mich recommended another thing you can digest! This green shakshuka by Shameless Media’s resident head chef, Jess Nguyen.

Here’s the link to Soaliha’s Instagram post we referenced about the premiere of The Bachelor.

      <description>G’day glorious people!

On today’s show: The music video for the new single 'WAP' by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion is here and it's SO damn saucy it broke the internet. Plus, what Bachelor in Paradise’s Ciarran and Timm tell us about male possessiveness over women. And then, the anti-wrinkle, anti-aging, totally baffling vagina masks that one Aussie model wants you to buy.

This week, Zara recommended the episode of The Daily, The Day That Shook Beirut. Mich recommended you watch the documentary, Three Identical Strangers, on Netflix.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: G Flip</title>
      <description>HELLOOOOO FRIEND!

Today on the show, we bring you the absolutely energising G Flip. G is a drummer-turned-solo-artist, singer songwriter, and music producer, who after uploading her single ‘About You’ to Triple J Unearthed in February 2018, has since become a star. G has performed at music festivals like Splendour in the Grass and One Night Stand to her thousands of fans, and released her debut studio album in August last year.

In this chat, G tells us about realising she was gay when she was just a child, the heartwarming moment her dad joined her on stage last year, as well as navigating a break up publicly amidst the train-wreck of a year that is 2020.

Here is that video of G bringing her dad onto the stage at One Night Stand in 2019 and IT’S SO DAMN WHOLESOME PLS WATCH.

If you’d like to hear more from G, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram @gflip. And for those In Conversation episodes we mentioned at the end of today’s episode, click here for Bridget Hustwaite, and here for The Veronicas.

      <itunes:summary>HELLOOOOO FRIEND!

Today on the show, we bring you the absolutely energising G Flip. G is a drummer-turned-solo-artist, singer songwriter, and music producer, who after uploading her single ‘About You’ to Triple J Unearthed in February 2018, has since become a star. G has performed at music festivals like Splendour in the Grass and One Night Stand to her thousands of fans, and released her debut studio album in August last year.

In this chat, G tells us about realising she was gay when she was just a child, the heartwarming moment her dad joined her on stage last year, as well as navigating a break up publicly amidst the train-wreck of a year that is 2020.

Here is that video of G bringing her dad onto the stage at One Night Stand in 2019 and IT’S SO DAMN WHOLESOME PLS WATCH.

If you’d like to hear more from G, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram @gflip. And for those In Conversation episodes we mentioned at the end of today’s episode, click here for Bridget Hustwaite, and here for The Veronicas.

      <title>Sister Bachelorettes and #ChallengeAccepted</title>
      <description>HOWDY FRIENDS!

On today’s show: We have - not one - but TWO bachelorettes this year, and the country is quite divided over the news. Plus, the controversy around the #womensupportingwomen challenge on Instagram, and then, did Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift date? We break down the dating rumour that just won’t go away.

This week, Zara recommended listening to The Sunday Read from The Daily, in particular, their episode, ‘The Accusation’. She also listened to Michelle Obama’s podcast episode with Barack that she reckons you’ll enjoy! Mich recommended following The Inspired Unemployed on Instagram or TikTok.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Calming Blankets. Use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout for $115 off your adult’s or children’s calming blankets.

Grab yourself a copy of ‘The Yield’ and join our Shameless Book Club convo next month! We’d love to have you! As we mentioned in today’s ep, head here to purchase it.

      <description>Oh hiiiii there, wonderful humans!

On today’s show: Do young people really lack resilience like Ita Buttrose said last week, and are they in need of more hugs? Plus, we need to talk about old mate Ziggy Alberts not being a fan of face masks. Then, we talk about Kanye West and the intersection of mental health and social media.

This week, Mich recommended watching Monica Lewinsky’s TED Talk, The price of shame. Zara recommended the interview with Bernardine Evaristo on How To Fail With Elizabeth Day.

As we mentioned in today’s episode, you can listen to Julia Gillard’s last parting speech here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Julia Gillard</title>
      <description>HI HOW ARE YOU OK ENOUGH CHIT CHAT BECAUSE...

Today on the show, we bring you the woman who needs no introduction - but we will attempt to give her one that does her justice - Julia Gillard. Julia was, of course, the first female Prime Minister of Australia, who is now the Chair of Beyond Blue, one of Australia’s leading mental health awareness bodies. Julia is also an avid advocate for addressing women’s under-representation in leadership, which was the motivation behind the book she just co-authored with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, ‘Women and Leadership’.

In this chat, Julia touches on the frustration that accompanies being a woman in politics, the moment she found out Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump, as well as her absolutely iconic misogyny speech.

If you’d like to hear more from Julia, please do check out her newest book that she co-wrote with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, ‘Women and Leadership’. Order it here! You can also order Julia’s memoir, ‘My Story’, here.

For those In Conversation episodes we mentioned at the end of today’s episode, click here for Dylan Alcott and here for Marlee Silva.

      <title>Everything is cake</title>
      <description>A big good morning to you all, including our very special birthday gal, ZARA MCDONALD!

On today’s show: What the fuck is going on with the “everything is cake” trend taking over twitter? Plus, we need to talk about the tragic death of Glee star Naya Rivera, and then, a discussion on the #FreeBritney movement that’s hit fever pitch.

This week, Mich recommended going to a dog park (if you have a dog, of course) to brighten our fellow Melburnians’ lockdown days. Zara recommended watching The Clinton Affair on SBS on Demand, as well as last Monday’s episode of Four Corners called “I Can’t Breathe” on ABC iView.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Brown Brothers. Don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout for free shipping on your order. We’ll also be doing an Instagram Live tasting Brown Brothers wine for a second time on Thursday the 30th of July. Join us for a chat! Bring wine!

      <description>Hiiiiiii fantastic friends!

Today on the show, we bring you the whip smart Nas Campanella. Nas is a journalist and the ABC’s first disability affairs reporter. She cut her teeth there and at Triple J, where she became one of the world’s first ever blind newsreaders.

In this chat, Nas talks with us about the neurological condition that means she can’t read Braille, her career thus far, and the love she found in her personal life.

If you’d like to hear more from Nas, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram at @nascampanella.

      <title>A king is dethroned</title>
      <description>Good morning, lovely listeners!

On today’s show: MICH ISSUES A RUSSELL CROWE-RELATED APOLOGY! Plus Paris Hilton is launching her 27th (... yes, 27th) fragrance and we want to know why there’s still so much hype around celebrity scents. And then, the Youtube drama clusterf**k that’s making its way into the mainstream.

This week, Zara recommended consuming any content featuring Glennon Doyle, particularly her episode on ABC’s Conversations. Soooo, remember when Mich read only the misleading headline of an article, mistaking Russell Crowe’s New Zealand slang for Australia’s? Yeah, she’s sorry ‘bout it, and recommends researching stuff better than she did.

Shameless book nerds! How are ya!?

Us? We are absolutely thrilled to bring you our very first Shameless Book Club chat of many, with a book we so adored. This month, we’re talking all about ‘Girl, Woman, Other’ by Bernardine Evaristo. As the joint winner of the 2019 Booker Prize, this book is a love song to Black womanhood in Britain, and follows the lives of twelve disparate characters.

Today on the show, Mich, Zara and Annabelle discuss the book’s absence of syntax and punctuation, our favourite characters, and juicy plot twists (we’re looking at you, Winsome).

      <title>Jenna Marbles de-platformed herself</title>
      <description>GUESS WHO’S BAAAACCKKK!? (... Back again. Mich and Zara are back. Tell a friend. Sorry.)

On today’s show: Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian may be getting back together and, well… we really hope not. Plus, YouTuber Jenna Marbles says she’s quitting Youtube after past racist videos. So, are we entering an era where celebrities are starting to de-platform themselves? And what do we expect from white influencers from here on in?

This week, Mich recommended the show Love Life on Stan. Zara recommended watching Famous in Love on Stan and reading our Shameless Book Club June pick, ‘Girl, Woman, Other’ by Bernardine Evaristo.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Garnier. Find out more about their new Rose Water Micellar Cleanser here.

If you haven’t listened to one of these before, this ‘The Archives’ series ventures deep into our backlog of chats to re-visit some of my (Annabelle's) absolute favourite moments of Shameless interviews. Mich and Zara return from their mid-year break on Monday, so this will be the last bonus episode for a little while.

Today, we’re talking about mental health. The fact is, a significant portion of the population will be diagnosed with a mental disorder at some point in their life. Yet still, a lot of us find it difficult to talk about our own struggles. What makes it feel a little less lonely, though? Hearing people in the public sphere so honestly share their own stories; stories many might resonate with in one way or another.

Today, we hear from: Georgie Dent, Osher Günsberg, Nawal Sari, Brandon Jack, Matt Okine, Abbie Chatfield, Hugh van Cuylenberg, Rosie Waterland, Mitchell Orval, Ash London, Celia Pacquola, Jules Von Hep, and Tanya Hennessy.

      <title>THE ARCHIVES: Women and the media</title>
      <description>Good morning to you, my friends! It’s Annabelle here!

Mich and Zara are on their mid-year break for a couple more weeks (*wipes away a single, dramatic tear*), which means I’ve got a couple more bonus episodes up my sleeve until their return. If you’re unaware, this ‘The Archives’ series ventures back into our backlog of chats to re-visit some of my absolute favourite moments of Shameless interviews.

Today’s theme is… women and the media. We’ve had such a diverse bunch of women join us for our In Conversation episodes since 2018; women who are unapologetically themselves in the otherwise very white, very male-dominated Australian media landscape. What’s it been like navigating it as women with varying cultural backgrounds, differing physical abilities, and life experiences?

Today, we hear from: Jamila Rizvi, Brooke Blurton, Priya Serrao, Brooke Boney, Melissa Leong, Marlee Silva, Georgie Stone, Carly Findlay, Jess Quinn, Neroli Meadows, Em Rusciano, Georgia Love, Brooke Jowett, and Clementine Ford.

      <title>THE ARCHIVES: Success</title>
      <description>BOO! IT’S ANNABELLE! WITH A SURPRISE EPISODE!

As you might know already, the girls are on their mid-year break for three weeks, so I’ve put together a few bonus episodes of some of my favourite moments of Shameless interviews, to fill the Mich and Zara shaped hole in my podcast feed. (It was selfish of me, really.)

Today’s theme is… success. How do some of Australia’s most accomplished people define it? To them, is success about work or family or something else entirely? We hear from past conversations with activists, influencers, entrepreneurs - you name it. In fact, I’ll name them all below and leave links to find their full Shameless interviews there, too.

Today’s lineup: Flex Mami, Courtney Act, Dylan Alcott, Emma Isaacs, Cyan Ta’eed, Zoë Foster Blake, Jess Quinn, Marlee Silva, Lana Wilkinson, Georgie Stone, Jules Von Hep, Rosie Waterland, Matt Okine, Clare Bowditch, Jan Fran, and Emma Carey.

      <description>HIYA FRIENDS!

Today on the show, we bring you the vibrant Mitchell Orval. You’ll likely know Mitch as the co-creator of the Angry Dad YouTube channel and for the popular content he now creates with his partner, Chloe, on social media.

In this chat, Mitch candidly talks about his past addiction to drugs and alcohol, as well as why he’s just buzzing to become a father very, very soon.

      <title>Anti-vaxxers and 'asking questions'</title>
      <description>Hey there, fabulous folks!

On today’s show: The anti-vaxxer movement's annoying PR glow-up. Plus, the ‘Call Her Daddy’ furore goes global. And then, how Emily Oberg killed her own brand, Sporty &amp; Rich, in a matter of days.

If you’d like to take action about what’s going on in the world right now, you can donate to the same charities Shameless Media has supported over the weekend: the Minnesota Freedom Fund and the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency.

Mich recommended one of our favourite episodes of In Isolation with Melissa Leong, and Zara recommended another nibble, Kellogg’s Crispix Cereal (certainly not sponsored, because Mich is... not a fan).

The readings on cultural appropriation from our Facebook threads are below. We implore you to give them all a read, as well as continue to do your own research.



‘7 Reasons Why White People Should Not Wear Black Hairstyles’ by Maisha Z. Johnson.


Deaths Inside: Indigenous Australian Deaths in Custody by The Guardian.


This Twitter thread by @GOLDENFILTER.

Such A Fun Age by Kiley Reid.

      <title>IN ISOLATION: Melissa Leong</title>
      <description>HELLO! It goes without saying we’re super excited to share today’s episode with you!

Today on the show, we bring you the glorious Melissa Leong. Melissa is a freelance food and travel writer, cookbook editor, radio broadcaster, and TV presenter. She’s been an esteemed food critic for publications like Time Out Sydney, and previously hosted SBS’s television series A Chef’s Line. She’s now working alongside Andy Allen and Jock Zonfrillo as a judge on Masterchef Australia, and has been requested as a guest on our show so many times we've honestly lost count.

In this chat, Melissa tells us exactly how she found out Masterchef Australia wanted her as a judge on the show, as well as her past experiences grappling with shame and culture.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Beefeater Gin. Don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ here for that generous discount!

If you’d like to see more from Melissa, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram at @fooderati.

      <title>IN ISOLATION: Turia Pitt</title>
      <description>G’day! It’s Thursday! Hooray!

Today on the show, we bring you the remarkable Turia Pitt. Turia is an author, mining engineer, athlete, and motivational speaker. In 2011, she was caught in a grassfire while running an ultramarathon, suffering severe burns to 65 per cent of her body as a result. In the almost decade since, Turia is now one of Australia’s most inspiring voices.

In this chat, we ask Turia exactly how she responds to her inner critic, as well as whether there’s pressure that comes with being such a leading voice on resilience at a time like this.

Thank you so much to Andalou Naturals. Their products are currently 40 per cent off (!!!) at Chemist Warehouse’s online store. Click here to shop.

If you’d like to see more from Turia, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram at @turiapitt. You can also find her School of Champions course here.

      <description>Hey hey! It’s Mondaaaayyy!

On today’s show: We try to decode Elon Musk and Grimes’ baby name. Plus, is publicly calling out trolls online off limits when they’re under the age of 18? And finally, we finish with a conversation about the current state of foodie culture.

This week, Zara recommended watching Normal People on Stan and eating Barbeque Shapes. (Not spon, just important.) Mich then recommended you get a Koala mattress. (Again, not spon, but equally as important.)

The GoFundMe for Ahmaud Arbery’s family is here.

      <title>IN ISOLATION: Celia Pacquola</title>
      <description>Happy In Isolation Thursday, self-isolated pals!

Today on the show, we bring you the very warm, very witty Celia Pacquola. When Celia isn't winning Dancing with the Stars Australia, she’s busy being one of Australia’s best comedians, writers and actors. Celia - along with Luke McGregor - is the brains behind the award-winning comedy series, Rosehaven, on the ABC, and has also appeared in Utopia, The Beautiful Lie, and Have You Been Paying Attention.

In our interview with Celia, we chat about it all: From how she got into comedy in the first place, to what it’s like navigating mental health in a pandemic when her mind is constantly idle. We felt instantly calmer after this chat with Celia, and we hope her charm lifts your day as much as it did ours.

Thank you so much to BROSA furniture for making this episode of Shameless possible. Find their stuff here, and don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at checkout for 20% off your order.

      <itunes:summary>Happy In Isolation Thursday, self-isolated pals!

Today on the show, we bring you the very warm, very witty Celia Pacquola. When Celia isn't winning Dancing with the Stars Australia, she’s busy being one of Australia’s best comedians, writers and actors. Celia - along with Luke McGregor - is the brains behind the award-winning comedy series, Rosehaven, on the ABC, and has also appeared in Utopia, The Beautiful Lie, and Have You Been Paying Attention.

In our interview with Celia, we chat about it all: From how she got into comedy in the first place, to what it’s like navigating mental health in a pandemic when her mind is constantly idle. We felt instantly calmer after this chat with Celia, and we hope her charm lifts your day as much as it did ours.

Thank you so much to BROSA furniture for making this episode of Shameless possible. Find their stuff here, and don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS20’ at checkout for 20% off your order.

If you’d like to see more from Celia, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram at @celia_pacquola.

      <title>The uncomfortable reality of internalised misogyny</title>
      <description>Well whaddya know! It’s Monday morning again!

On today’s show: Meghan and Harry are releasing a book, but do the headlines tell the real story? Plus, a deep dive on Jameela Jamil’s Instagram experiment says about internalised misogyny.

This week, Mich recommended you listen to the podcast, The Briefing, and Zara recommended the Stan series, The Loudest Voice.

Record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com) It can be about anything pod related! Or unrelated! We just wanna chat, pretty please. OK, we're done being clingy. Love you.


Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, ANZ. Find out more about their 50-30-20 budget here.

      <title>IN ISOLATION: Sammy Robinson</title>
      <description>Good morning, you wonderful humans!

Today on the show, we bring you the lovely Sammy Robinson. Sammy has grown a vast social media following after starting on YouTube only four years ago, uploading beauty tutorials from the comfort of her bedroom. Now, she works with fashion and beauty brands globally, and is about to launch her very own clothing label, One Mile.

In our chat with Sammy, we touch on everything: From what it’s like launching One Mile when the world is in such chaos, to whether she thinks COVID-19 will change influencer culture forever after things start to shift back to normal.

Thank you so much to The Body Shop and Plan International Australia’s Youth Activist Series for making this episode of Shameless possible. Check it out here.

If you’d like to see more from Sammy, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram at @sammmyrobinson. And please do check out One Mile on Instagram too, at @onemile.thelabel!

      <title>God bless female Agents of Chaos</title>
      <description>Yoohoo! It’s us! We’ve missed you!

On today’s show: Our very random and almost inexplicable obsession with tonal loungewear. Plus, why in the world does Dr Phil still have a platform but no practicing certificate. And finally, a deepdive on the Netflix show Too Hot to Handle and female agents of chaos (a term coined by by VICE’s Lauren O’Neill and Emma Garland that we LOVE).

This week, Zara recommended you listen to Daniel Radcliffe’s podcast episode on Desert Island Discs here. Mich did a whoopsies and forgot to recommend something this week, but all is forgiven considering her phenomenal work on our open letter to Margot Robbie. Check it out here.

Record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com) It can be about anything pod related! Or unrelated! We just wanna chat, pretty please. OK, we're done being clingy. Love you.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, The Oodie. Head here to get $30 off your order by using the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout. And the generosity continues! The Oodie is also running a giveaway on our Instagram page so keep an eye out for it over there to enter.

      <title>IN ISOLATION: Osher Günsberg</title>
      <description>Hello helloooooo!

Today on the show, we bring you someone who likely needs no introduction at all: Osher Günsberg. You probably fell in love with Osher when he was the host of Australian Idol all the way back in 2003. Since then, he’s gone on to become one of the country’s most successful television personalities as the host of The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and The Masked Singer.

In our interview with Osher, we cover everything: From what it’s like filming in The Bachelor mansion, to his passion for spreading mental health and climate change awareness.

Thank you so much to The Body Shop and Plan International Australia’s Youth Activist Series for making this episode of Shameless possible. Check it out here.

If you’d like to see more from Osher, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow him on Instagram at @osher_gunsberg.

To grab a copy of Osher’s book, Back, After the Break, head here. And to get his wonderful podcast, Better Than Yesterday, in your ears, click here.

At the end of today’s episode, we mentioned a couple others we think you might enjoy! Click here for Georgia Love and here for Rosie Waterland.

      <title>The Great Avocado Debate</title>
      <description>Hellloooooo Monday! Or is it Tuesday? Friday?

On today’s show: How Masterchef reclaimed the Australian reality television throne after years of slumping ratings. Then, Reese Witherspoon’s Instagram marketing debacle, and finally, the very odd trend of sharing your #pandemicdreams online.

This week, Mich recommended you bless your eyeballs with Unorthodox on Netflix. (Yeah yeah, Zara suggested you do the same last week, but just watch it, kay?). Zara recommended you listen to this episode of The Daily about the allegations levelled at Joe Biden, and this interview with Alain De Botton on How To Fail With Elizabeth Day.

Record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com) It can be about anything pod related! Or unrelated! We just wanna chat, pretty please. OK, we're done being clingy. Love you.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Bioré. Head here to check out their products.

      <title>IN ISOLATION: The Resilience Project’s Hugh van Cuylenburg</title>
      <description>Good morning! Or arvo! Or night! We’re rambling!

Today on the show, we bring you the uplifting Hugh van Cuylenburg. For those unaware, Hugh is the school teacher turned mental health pioneer behind The Resilience Project - an organisation that works with schools, sports clubs, and businesses to provide evidence-based, positive mental health strategies to build resilience and happiness.

In our interview with Hugh, we talk about it all: From the pivotal trip to Northern India that changed his life, to the impact his sister’s battle with Anorexia Nervosa had on his perspective.

Just a quick note: this episode covers issues around disordered eating and might be triggering for some listeners.

Thank you so much to James Cosmetics for making this episode of Shameless possible. Head here to grab yourself or a pal somethin’ nice, and make sure you use the code ‘SHAMELESS25’ at checkout for 25% absolutely anything (!!!) on the site.

If you’d like to see more from Hugh, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow him on Instagram at @theresilienceproject.

Check out Hugh’s podcast, The Imperfects, which he hosts alongside Ryan Shelton by clicking here. Hugh has also written a book! Find out about it here. And to get your mitts on the wellbeing journal Hugh mentioned at the end of this episode, head here.

      <title>A love letter to Florence Pugh</title>
      <description>Hi there lovely listener friends!

On today’s show: Are we finally seeing the death of influencer unboxings? Plus, the sharp rise of Florence Pugh and her epic handling of online trolling, and then, how conspiracy theories are given room to thrive in a period of time like this one.

This week, Mich recommended you watch Lion on Netflix, and Zara recommended another Netflix goodie, Unorthodox.

Record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com) It can be about anything pod related! Or unrelated! We just wanna chat, pretty please. OK, we're done being clingy. Love you.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Lo Bros. Head here to find out more about their delicious bevvies. And because Lo Bros are oh so generous, they’re running the greatest competition ever for the greatest Shameless community ever. Go to our Instagram page to find out how to win a year’s supply of kombucha and WHADDYA STILL DOING HERE? Go go go!

      <title>IN ISOLATION: Brooke Boney</title>
      <description>Today’s the day! The day we introduce you to our very first, very special In Isolation episode.

On the show this week, we bring you the delightful Brooke Boney. Brooke is a Gamilaroi woman who grew up in Muswellbrook, NSW, and is currently an entertainment reporter on The Today Show. You’ll likely be familiar with her work before that too, as a journalist on NITV, the ABC, and Triple J.

In our interview with Brooke, we cover everything: From what she thought her year was going to look like to how she’s coping in these strange times. As well as that, Brooke also touches on how she really hopes - when the curtain lifts from all the chaos - that she’ll care a little less about what people think of her.

Thank you so much to ANZ for making this episode of Shameless possible. Head to their website here to find out more.

If you’d like to see more from Brooke, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram at @boneybrooke.

      <title>Celebrity culture is crumbling</title>
      <description>A big, caps-locked HELLLLOOOO to you, Shameless besties!

On today’s show: Mason Disick is the Instagram and Tik Tok deviant we didn't know we needed right now. Plus, why Tiger King will perhaps be the most meme-able moment of 2020, and finally, the New York Times article that convinced us that celebrity culture may be crumbling right before us.

This week, Mich recommended you all download Tik Tok and do this TV character personality test (Link pls Mich xxx). Zara recommended reading this article in The Guardian by Elliott Dallen and getting anything by or with Seth Godin in your ears.

Record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com) It can be about anything remaining positive right now! Or your thoughts on the latest pod! We just wanna chat, pretty please. OK, we're done being clingy. Love you.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, The Oodie. Head here to grab yourself one, and use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ for $30 off your order.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Lana Wilkinson</title>
      <description>OH HAI!

Today on the show, we bring you the absolute dynamo that is Lana Wilkinson. Lana is a celebrity stylist who has dressed the likes of Megan Gale, Rebecca Judd, Ruby Rose, and Zoe Foster Blake as well as a designer, having launched her own self-titled shoe brand in 2019.

Given the state of the world, we were feeling a little deflated when we walked into this interview with Lana two weeks ago, but our moods were immediately lifted by Lana’s kindness and light, as well as her insights into pursuing your career and making your big dreams a reality.

Thank you so much to Bangn Body for making this episode of Shameless possible. Check out their products here and don’t forget to use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout for 10% off your order.

If you’d like to see more from Lana, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram at @lanawilkinson.

      <title>We want to lie down</title>
      <description>Hello hello, lovely people!

On today’s show: How the satirical news website Betoota Advocate somehow, oh so cleverly, Trojan-horsed us all. Plus, a discussion on the reignited Kimye/Taylor Swift feud, and finally, why the concept of self-optimising in this time of self isolation is kinda annoying.

This week, Mich recommended the Netflix show Tiger King and Zara recommended the app HouseParty.

Looking for that collection of hilarious conference call stories on Jules Von Hep’s Instagram? Read it right here. And that Taylor Swift article by Joel Golby in The Guardian? You can find it here.

Record a voice message and send it to hotline@shamelessmediaco.com (that's *CO*.com) It can be about anything pod related! Or unrelated! We just wanna chat, pretty please. OK, we’re done being clingy. Love you.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Fantastic Furniture. Head here to check out their aptly named, very, very fantastic furniture.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Dylan Alcott</title>
      <description>Hiiiiii listener friends!

You asked, we listened. Today, we bring you the man you’ve all been wanting on the show for quite some time: the utterly impressive Dylan Alcott. Dylan is a professional athlete, media personality, motivational speaker, bestselling author, and disability advocate. (And us? We’re completely out of breath just typing that.)

In this episode, we talk about the childhood moment that shaped Dylan’s approach to life, his career jump from pro basketball to tennis, and the love story with his partner Chantelle.

      <description>The greatest of mornings to you all, Shameless family!

On today’s show: We hear from a few of your lovely voices via our brand new Shameless hotline. Then, we talk about the Hayley Williams profile that made us think a little deeper about female anger and how to harness it. Finally, a conversation on the lipstick effect and self care in an era of economic downturn.

Zara recommended two episodes of the podcast This American Life: The Show of Delights episode and their Birds &amp; Bees episode. She also recommended linen clothing from Kehoe because YES TO LINEN CLOTHING. Mich recommended you watch 9 Life Lessons from Tim Minchin on Youtube. Also! Lou Lou Lips, if you’re looking for some local, top quality lippies.

Give us a buzz on 0482 472 301 and talk to us! About anything pod related! Or unrelated! We just wanna chat, pretty please. OK, we’re done being clingy. Love you.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, Tribe Skincare. Head here to shop their products and to use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout for 10% off storewide.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Brooke Jowett</title>
      <description>OH HELLO! Happy In Conversation day, listener friend!

Today on the show, we’re joined by the sunny Brooke Jowett. If you’re a fan of Survivor Australia, you’ll no doubt be familiar with Brooke, who has now appeared on two separate seasons of the show (the first, which aired in 2016, and the one on your television screens right now!).

In this episode, we talk about how Brooke made a name for herself as a fierce competitor on the show so many of us adore, as well as how she feels about dominating headlines lately. Sure, Brooke’s the woman who was blindsided by the country’s next big Bachelor star. But she’s also the woman who’s shown Australia what she’s made of - twice - without a phone, or a wardrobe, or any of the creature comforts that keep you and I sane day-to-day.

Thank you so much to Bioré for making this episode of Shameless possible. Check out Bioré’s pore strips here.

To listen to the other In Convo eps we mentioned at the end of this episode, follow ze links: click here for Abbie Chatfield and here for Tully Smyth.

If you’d like to hear more from Brooke, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram @brookejowett.

      <title>A little dose of joy</title>
      <description>Oh hi there, glorious listener pals!

Today on the show: A discussion on how we seek out joy during a time of overwhelmingly rampant news coverage. Where are the slithers of light amongst the dark? Where is the line between being educated about world events and being utterly overwhelmed? Then, we jump right to the biggest pop culture news story of the week - the Woody Allen memoir that was pulled just before its release to the public.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Jules Von Hep</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday to all our fine-footed friends in the world!

Today on the show we are joined by Jules Von Hep, who we also like to refer to as a human ray of sunshine. Jules is a celebrity tanning expert, the founder of tanning juggernaut Isle of Paradise, co-host of the Jules and Sarah podcast and champion of body confidence.

We first met Jules last year when we hosted MECCALAND and were immediately drawn to him: he is one of the kindest, warmest, most exuberant humans we have ever had the pleasure of meeting through this job. Yes, Jules is a tanning expert - and has tanned some of the most famous women in the world - but goodness, he is also so much more than that. Jules is a warrior for body confidence, infusing much of his ethos about loving and embracing our bodies on his Instagram feed and in his brand.

A quick plot twist before we jump into this chat - Zara wasn’t actually there. She fell ill on the morning we were due to record with Jules and, because he lives in London, it was impossible to re-schedule. So, while she had huge amounts of FOMO listening to this one back, she loved SO much getting the pleasure of enjoying this one as a listener. Mich and Jules cover everything from his battle with an eating disorder as a young man, to tanning celebrities like Kendall Jenner to the birth of his mammoth, internationally stocked beauty brand, Isle of Paradise.

For more from Jules, you can find him @julesvonhep and @theisleofparadise. As always, we are @shamelesspodcast.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor DiDi. Simply use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ to receive $20 worth of vouchers, redeemable in all Australian cities where DiDi is operating.

      <title>Do you have 'interxiety'?</title>
      <description>It’s Monday! AND a public holiday! AAAAND episode drop day! Hooray!

On today’s show: Toilet paper. Yes, you know exactly what we’re talking about. The great Australian toilet paper shortage of 2020 that’s left us completely perplexed. Plus, we look into The Bachelor Australia’s false start with their announcement of Locky Gilbert as next season’s star. And finally, how ‘interxiety’ - a term we most definitely made up - has kept us up this week.

This week, Mich recommended the newest book by Marian Keyes, Grown Ups. Find it here. Zara recommended Elizabeth Kate Russell’s book, My Dark Vanessa, which you can find here.

Thank you so much to today’s sponsor, ANZ. To download their app we spoke about in today’s episode, head here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Neroli Meadows</title>
      <description>Yoohoo! It’s us again, rudely interrupting your Thursday morning! (And we aren’t even sorry about it.)

Today on the show, we’re joined by the delightfully vibrant Neroli Meadows: one of the country’s leading sports commentators and television presenters.

In this episode, we dive into it all: From Neroli’s close relationship with her siblings to the highlights of working her way up in a male dominated industry. We also touch on what grappling with losing a job is like when it's so tied to your personal and public identity, as well as how Neroli has dealt with re-shaping her career after rejection.

Thank you so much to Denada Sugar Free Ice Cream for making this episode of Shameless possible. Purchase Denada’s goodies here.

Neroli is just about to release her very own independent podcast, Ordineroli Speaking. Be sure to keep an eye out for its release in the weeks to come, and click here to follow the podcast on Instagram.

To check out those other In Conversation interviews we mentioned at the end of this episode, follow ze links: click here to listen to Jo Weston, and here for Brandon Jack.

If you’d like to hear more from Neroli, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram @nezm. As for us? We're @shamelesspodcast.

Plus, a discussion on Harvey Weinstein’s conviction and the aftermath of it all.

This week, Mich recommended the podcast Dying For Sex. Find it here. Zara recommended the documentary The Australian Dream, which you can watch here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Courtney Act</title>
      <description>Hiya friends! Strap yourselves in, ‘cause this one’s a goodie. (Are we allowed to say that about our own podcast episode? Screw it. IT’S AMAZING.)

Today we’re joined by the ridiculously entertaining Courtney Act: a drag queen, entertainer and singer who has graced television screens across not just in Australia, but around the world.

In this episode, we talk about it all: from Courtney’s schooling experience in Brisbane as Shane Jenek, to how Courtney Act came to life. We also cover why drag is such an important part of her identity, as well as her time on Australian Idol, Big Brother UK and Ru Paul’s Drag Race.

Thank you so much to ShopBack for making this episode of Shameless possible. Check out ShopBack here.

Courtney is currently touring her new live show FLUID in Sydney and Darwin. Click here for more details and to buy tickets.

To check out those other In Conversation interviews we mentioned at the end of this episode, follow ze links: click here to listen to Georgie Stone, and here for Em Rusciano.

If you’d like to hear more from Courtney, which you no doubt 1000% do, follow her on Instagram @courtneyact. As for us? We're @shamelesspodcast.

Join our glorious Shameless Podcast Facebook community here, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories.

      <title>The one where 'Mercury retrograde' breaks us</title>
      <description>HAPPY MONDAY TEAM!

On today’s show: Why the heck does everyone keep talking about Mercury being in retrograde? Plus, what the death of Caroline Flack says about internet culture and then, how Ben Affleck is pulling out all the stops to win back the affection of the public.

This week, Mich recommended going to a discount Adidas store lol which definitely isn’t a proper recommendation but we are rolling with it anyway. Zara recommended an episode of Australian True Crime called Defending the Indefensible.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Zoë Foster Blake</title>
      <description>YES! Today is the day. And from this point on, the 20th of February 2020 will be forever known as Shameless Christmas. Also, the day with the best numerology in the history of the universe (20/02/2020 - what a date, what a time).

But enough about number orgasms! This is about Zoë, AKA former beauty journalist, the author of ten books and the founder of Go-To (and Bro-To... and Gro-To) Skin Care. Also, the curator of Very Good Instagram Accounts and purveyor of Extremely Good Advice.

In this episode, we cover a lot; from the early days of Zoë's career to building a huge beauty brand, the self-doubt that can rear its head, motherhood, and what it’s like to be one half of the country’s golden couple.

You're almost definitely following Zoë on Instagram anyway, but just in case, she's @zotheysay. We're @shamelesspodcast.

      <title>Say hello to ‘medfluencers’</title>
      <description>WAHOOOOO IT’S MONDAY! Thanks so much for giving us your ears for this hour of power.

On today’s show: WHO WON DOGGO OF SHAMELESS? Plus! The divorce announcement that we care about deeply and the rise of medfluencers - doctors, dieticians and nurses who are making money on Instagram. And - finally - the opinion piece on the Karen meme that was so contentious, it was the top trending topic on Twitter in Australia over the weekend.

Mich forgot to recommend anything because she was too busy talking about the new baby burrito. Can she recommend you become an aunty? Because she wants to recommend that. Zara recommended 7am’s episode, Profiting from Auschwitz. She recommends Michelle shut the eff up about babies.
Some links from today’s episode:


Read Eve Simmons’s piece on medfluencers.

Read Julia Baird’s story on the Karen meme.


A big thank you to today’s sponsor, Maybelline. Check out their new Falsies Lash Lift Mascara here. 

Craving more? You’re only human. Join our glorious Shameless Podcast Facebook community here, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you chuck us a follow on Instagram @shamelesspodcast instead?

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Nawal Sari</title>
      <description>GOOD MORNING! GOOD THURSDAY! GOOD LISTENER FRIENDS!

Today on the show, we have the glorious Nawal Sari. Nawal is an influencer committed to redefining modest fashion, and has turned her love of fashion into a burgeoning career. In this interview, we sit down to discuss Nawal’s decision to wear the hijab in high school, as well as what it’s like becoming a bit of an accidental big sister to a community of 120,000 young women.

Follow Nawal on Instagram @nawalsari. As for us? We're @shamelesspodcast.

If you enjoyed this episode, please do check out our interviews with beauty influencers Rowi Singh and Jade Tuncdurok in 2019. They are goodies, if we do say so ourselves.

A big thank you to today's sponsor, Maybelline New York and their new Falsies Lash Lift Mascara. Get your mitts on it in stores or online.

      <title>Teen mags screwed us up</title>
      <description>A very happy Monday to you, lovely people! On today’s show: a look back at all the effed articles we consumed in teenage magazines. Plus, we watched Gwyneth Paltrow’s new Netflix special Goop Lab and have lots of thoughts and then, why people suddenly became prudish when Shakira and JLo took their clothes off at the Superbowl halftime show.

Mich recommended Chasing Cosby, and Zara recommended last week’s episode of Four Corners called Black Summer.

Some links from today’s episode:

Watch Rebel Wilson’s full BAFTAs speech here.

Read the Pedestrian article we spoke about in today’s episode, with extracts from old, effed magazine articles.

Read Jennifer Paola Varela Rodriguez's PopSugar story on JLo and Shakira's halftime performance.


A big thank you to today’s sponsor, Maybelline. Check out their new Falsies Lash Lift Mascara here. 

Thanks so much to Bondi Boost for getting behind Doggo of Shameless and gifting the winner a $500 prize pack plus a year's supply of Pooch Wash!!!

Today on the show we are joined by Rosie Waterland. Rosie is a writer and comedian who began her career writing recaps of The Bachelor for Mamamia. Since then, she's achieved so much we honestly feel a little dizzy, err, recapping it all.

Rosie has written two bestselling books - The Anti Cool Girl and Every Lie I’ve Ever Told - hosted an award-winning podcast, My Mum Says My Memoir is a Lie, toured Australia with two sold out one-woman shows (with a third coming!) and written for TV, too. Oh, and last year she signed a two-book deal with Harper Collins Australia, announcing her foray into fiction. NO BIG DEAL. EVERYTHING IS FINE.

Just a content note on this one: we do cover issues of suicide, addiction and details of childhood trauma in this episode and it may be triggering for some listeners.

Follow Rosie on Instagram: @rosiewaterland
Listen to Rosie's podcast, Just The Gist here.
Head along to one of her shows! Rosie is doing her Kid Chameleon show in Canberra on the 23rd of February and then heads to South Australia on the 25th. You can buy your tickets here.

      <title>From Kobe to Taylor</title>
      <description>OH FAM, IT’S A BIG ONE THIS WEEK. Happy Monday!

Today we go everywhere from the very random, very silly Instagram feud between influencer Mitchell Orval and food critic John Lethlean, the tragic death and complicated legacy of Kobe Bryant and then, the Taylor Swift documentary we’d been waiting weeks for.

Some links for you from today’s show:

Mich recommended this New York Times profile of Jessica Simpson and Zara recommended this episode of The Hollywood Reporter’s Awards Chatter podcast.

Extra reading: Kobe Bryant and Complicated Legacies by Jill Filipovic, Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser’s Story, and the Half-Confession by Marlow Stern, ‘Taylor Swift: Miss Americana’ Review: A Star, Scathingly Alone.

A big thank you to today’s sponsor, ANZ. Check out their financial wellbeing calculator here.

Join our glorious Shameless Podcast Facebook community here, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you chuck us a follow on Instagram @shamelesspodcast instead?

      <title>So do we call them ‘Braniston’ or ‘Anipitt’?</title>
      <description>HAPPY MONDAY, WONDERFUL LISTENER FRIENDS!

Man oh man, do we have a lot to talk about. Firstly, let’s cover the Triple J Hottest 100, and what the results over the last three decades say about us. Then, every little thing about BRAD AND JEN (!!!!!!) and the Alec Baldwin interview that made our mouths hit the floor.

This week, Mich recommended Sex Education on Netflix. Zara recommended you go see Little Women at your local cinema and that you listen to The Daily’s episode on Meghan and Harry.

Read that wild Jen Aniston profile in Vanity Fair here.
Aaaaand that infuriating Alec Baldwin interview is here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Clementine Ford</title>
      <description>It’s our first In Conversation of 2020 and it’s a gooooood one. Today on the show we are joined by the formidable force that is Clementine Ford. Of course, you’re likely to know Clem for her writing on feminism and as the author of Fight Like a Girl and Boys will be Boys. But who is Clem Ford behind the writing and activism we know so well? We sat down with Clem in her Melbourne home to chat all about her work, yes, but what it was like growing up all over the Middle East and how motherhood changed everything.

Just setting the scene on this one before we jump in: we recorded this in Clem’s apartment with a train line nearby which may hear very occasionally through the chat, but we think you will love it all the same.

Here are some links to buy Clem’s books Fight Like a Girl and Boys will be Boys.

A big thank you to today’s sponsor Denada Sugar Free Ice Cream.

      <title>Beware the women!!!</title>
      <description>AAAAND WE ARE BACK!!! Happy happy happy 2020 Shameless fam - we couldn’t be more excited for our first episode of the year. So, what’s on the agenda? One of the biggest Youtube star’s comes out as transgender. Plus, what the actual eff happened to the royal family while we were away, and how do we feel about Megxit? Then, some thoughts on influencers, Instagram brands, and public shaming.

This week, Zara recommended you read Such a Fun Age by Kiley Reid. Mich recommended the film Marriage Story and the reality show The Circle, both on Netflix.

Also, to read a little more about the complexities of Celeste Barber’s fundraiser, you can here. That brilliant piece by Kathy McCabe for Rendezview is here.

A big thank you to today’s sponsor Moscato One by Brown Brothers.

      <title>In 2020 #IPledge</title>
      <description>Hey friends! Happy New Year! We hope you've enjoyed some much-deserved time out with your loved ones.

Today we are re-sharing one of our favourite episodes of 2019 - our In Conversation episode with Natalie Fornasier. We first came across Natalie and her story when she sat down with Byrdie.com.au in 2018 for a piece titled “I’m 24 and Living With Advanced Melanoma—This Is My Story”. Natalie’s words and insights in that interview were what informed our very last segment of Shameless in 2018, and what pushed us to change our own relationship with sun tanning forever. We had Nat as a guest at our Sydney live show in November, and are so lucky to now call her a friend.

Nat is now battling stage four melanoma after the cancer spread to her small intestine and bowel. Given today marks a new year and a new decade, we thought now is the time to help Nat champion her message again. So, Team Shameless has enlisted the help of some of Australia's most influential and recognisable women to make a pledge toward sun safety in 2020. You can watch our #IPledge video on our Instagram page @shamelesspodcast at midday today.

The Pledge:

Did you know melanoma is the third most common cancer in Australian women? It kills more young people in our country than any other form of cancer.

So in 2020, I pledge:

To wear sunscreen.

To get my tan from a can.

And to take notice of my skin - and do whatever I can to protect it.

I pledge to get my skin checked if I feel like something’s wrong, or if it’s been a while.

To never glamourise sun tanning to my followers.

And to educate myself and others about the risks.

In 2020, I’m going to be safe in the sun. And I encourage you to do the same.

      <title>The end of a decade</title>
      <description>IT’S THE FINAL EPISODE OF THE YEAR AND IT’S A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL! KINDA. Well, look, there will be presents and this Christmas jingle and we did probably consume a little too much champagne while recording it.

What are we TALKING about though?! Well, there’s the curious Christmas Instagram campaign that is unlike anything we’ve seen. Plus, the best pop culture moments of the last decade, and the Chrissy Teigen and John Legend argument that sings to our souls.

We’re taking a wee little break but don’t stress, we will be BACK in your ears on January 20!

A big thank you to today’s sponsor Skydive Australia. Remember! Use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout until the 29th of February next year for $40 off your booking.

Craving more? You’re only human.

      <itunes:summary>IT’S THE FINAL EPISODE OF THE YEAR AND IT’S A CHRISTMAS SPECIAL! KINDA. Well, look, there will be presents and this Christmas jingle and we did probably consume a little too much champagne while recording it.

What are we TALKING about though?! Well, there’s the curious Christmas Instagram campaign that is unlike anything we’ve seen. Plus, the best pop culture moments of the last decade, and the Chrissy Teigen and John Legend argument that sings to our souls.

We’re taking a wee little break but don’t stress, we will be BACK in your ears on January 20!

A big thank you to today’s sponsor Skydive Australia. Remember! Use the code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout until the 29th of February next year for $40 off your booking.

      <title>Generation 'Instagram Face'</title>
      <description>HAPPY SECOND MONDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS SHAMELESS FAM AND YES WE WILL KEEP YELLING ABOUT THIS UNTIL AFTER CHRISTMAS. On the show today: Our obsession with finding words and colours to define the year that was. Plus, the age of Instagram Face and then, a look at Rihanna’s 2019: one that saw her the centre of the public consciousness, despite not releasing a second of music.

Zara recommended Morning Wars on Apple TV and Mich recommended Terrace House on Netflix.

Today's episode was made possible by our sponsor Moscato One by Brown Brothers: refreshingly-spritzed Moscato that contains exactly one standard drink.

Read Jia Tolentino's New Yorker piece on 'Instagram Face' here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Bel Sloane</title>
      <description>Hello lovely listeners!

Today we have a powerful interview with Bel Sloane. In case you’re not familiar with her name, Bel is a television presenter for Channel 7. She’s also the wife of AFL star and captain of the Adelaide Crows, Rory Sloane. In 2018, Bel and Rory lost their first child Leo, who was born sleeping. In this interview, we talk about that grief, but also the love that Leo brought to both of their lives. We also talk about what it was like to fall pregnant again with their little boy, Sonny, and the mechanics of keeping that entire pregnancy secret from the outside world.

While we sat with Bel in her Adelaide home, there was a great, big Christmas tree right beside us. On the Christmas tree were a collection of baubles that read the names of their little family - Mum, Dad, Sonny and Leo - the little warrior who will never be forgotten, and whose passing ignited a legacy that will help Australian parents for years to come.

Thanks to our sponsor Hey Tiger for making this episode of Shameless episode possible. Use our code SHAMELESSHOLIDAY at checkout to receive a free full-size bar of chocolate, worth $15.

You can follow Bel on Instagram @bel_sloane. If you enjoyed this episode, we also recommend you listen to our chat with Leigh Campbell, which you can find here.

If you or a loved one is struggling with pregnancy loss, support is available at SANDS. You can call any time, day or night, on 1300 072 637.

Join our glorious Shameless Podcast Facebook community here, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you chuck us a follow on Instagram @shamelesspodcast instead?

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Steph Claire Smith</title>
      <description>It’s little Friday and boy, are we happy about it! Today we’ve got a good one for you, because we are joined by the powerhouse that is Steph Claire Smith. Or, now, Miller. Steph entered the public consciousness as a model, and a wildly successful one at that, but since then has crafted a career that exists well beyond the modelling industry. Today, she is the co-founder of fitness app Keep it Cleaner, sunglass company Soda Shades and bikini brand Midnight. She’s the face of Bondi Sands, an ambassador for Adidas and the co-author of a book, too. And, yes, she’s still only 25.

We sat down with Steph to talk about business, yes, but also the scrutiny of being in the public eye, her very recent and high profile wedding and the kinds of criticisms that hurt the most.

Also a big thank you to today’s sponsor Kester Black. Remember, with the code SHAMELESS at checkout you can receive a FREE (!!) lipstick with any order. Visit www.kesterblack.com to check them out.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Emma Carey</title>
      <description>Happy, happy, happy Thursday you wonderful people!

Em is known as the girl who fell from the sky: at just 20 years old, when skydiving in Switzerland, her parachute failed to open properly. She plummeted from the sky, landing on the ground completely paralysed from the waist down. She spent months in hospital re-learning how to move her body again. Today, Emma is a walking paraplegic. As she documented her recovery and her re-birth (as she now calls it) Emma built a hugely loyal following thanks to her sunny and warm and thoughtful posts. But often, behind the scenes, things were much harder than she presented them on Instagram. Last week, we sat down with her in Brisbane and asked her all about it.

Also a big thank you so much to today’s sponsor The Body Shop. Book your spot with Mrs Claus online now at thebodyshop.com.au.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Clare Bowditch</title>
      <description>Happy, happy, happy Thursday our favourite listeners!

Today on the show, we’re joined by Clare Bowditch, a musician and actress who has now released her memoir, Your Own Kind of Girl, a book that explores the stories we tell ourselves and what happens when we believe them. In this episode we talk about what it’s like to lose a sister, be sent to a diet doctor when you’re still in primary school, and accept yourself when the world tells you that you shouldn’t.

A bit of a trigger warning on this one, too: this episode discusses eating disorders in a manner that might be triggering for some listeners.

If you’d love to hear more from Clare, you can do two things: buy her book Your Own Kind of Girl, or follow her on Instagram @clarebowditch.

Also a big thank you so much to today’s sponsor Urban You. Don't forget to use our code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout for $30 off your clean!

      <title>OK, Boomer</title>
      <description>HIYA and HAPPY MONDAY LOVELY PEOPLE!

Coming up on today’s show: it was a big night for reality TV finales on Thursday and the results sparked a rather furious divide between Australians: when it comes to daylight savings and the shows airing at different times in different states, whose responsibility is it to keep the result under wraps? Plus, a conversation about celebrity fundraisers in the wake of natural disasters and then, the OK Boomer meme that has infiltrated the internet.

This week, Zara recommends you read Catch and Kill by Ronan Farrow, while Mich recommends Three Women by Lisa Taddeo.

Today's episode was made possible by our sponsor The Body Shop, the original nature-inspired, cruelty free beauty brand fighting for a fairer and more beautiful world.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Erin Brockovich</title>
      <description>Helloooooo, favourite listener friends! Today on the show we have the enigmatic Erin Brockovich. In the year 2000, the award-winning film starring Julia Roberts told the true story of Erin’s involvement in a case against a Californian power company. Ever since, Erin has continued to work in the environmental sphere and has regularly visited Australia as the ambassador for Shine Lawyers.

In our chat with Erin, we asked her about her environmental activism, what it’s like coming into such a large sum of money so unexpectedly, and her relationship with the label “feminist icon”. And yes, we talk a bit about Julia Roberts too...

If you loved this chat with Erin, you can find more from her at @the_real_erin_brockovich on Instagram. After you follow Erin, may we recommend you also listen to our interview with the marvellous Em Rusciano too? You can feast your ears (eyes? who knows!) on that one right here.

Thank you to our sponsor Tribe Skincare for making today’s episode possible. Find out more about Tribe Skincare here and use our code ‘SHAMELESS’ at checkout for 10% off AND free express shipping.

      <itunes:summary>Helloooooo, favourite listener friends! Today on the show we have the enigmatic Erin Brockovich. In the year 2000, the award-winning film starring Julia Roberts told the true story of Erin’s involvement in a case against a Californian power company. Ever since, Erin has continued to work in the environmental sphere and has regularly visited Australia as the ambassador for Shine Lawyers.

In our chat with Erin, we asked her about her environmental activism, what it’s like coming into such a large sum of money so unexpectedly, and her relationship with the label “feminist icon”. And yes, we talk a bit about Julia Roberts too...

If you loved this chat with Erin, you can find more from her at @the_real_erin_brockovich on Instagram. After you follow Erin, may we recommend you also listen to our interview with the marvellous Em Rusciano too? You can feast your ears (eyes? who knows!) on that one right here.

This week, Zara recommends you... uhh... listen to Christmas music (???). Mich recommends you buy her el cheapo Michael Bublé perfume, By Invitation.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Sophie Cachia</title>
      <description>Haaaaappy Thursday mates! Boy do we have a cracker of an episode in store.

Today we are joined by the force of nature that is Sophie Cachia - blogger, presenter and one of Australia’s most influential voices. Here, we talk about falling pregnant at the age of 22, finding your feet in a sea of commentary and feedback, and how to navigate a marriage breakdown when you’re still figuring out your sexuality.

For more from Sophie, follow her on Instagram @sophiecachia_.

Loved this? We think you’ll also enjoy our interview with Abbie Chatfield.

      <title>Meet the new Jenna Dewan</title>
      <description>HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY Monday to our favourite Shameless people! On the agenda today: The Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum divorce that was far grittier than their official statement ever let on. Plus, the landmark ruling that could shake up the reality TV industry and a meaty discussion on the merits and shortcomings of marriage.

This week, Zara recommends an old episode of Ladies We Need to Talk called Settling for Average, and Mich was SUPPOSED to recommend a banger playlist Triple J's Bridget Hustwaite made for us after our interview with her went live, but got so caught up in the "I'm not Joey" stuff she totally forgot. Sorry.

Today's episode was made possible by our sponsor Uber Stay by Le Tan. Find out more about their 10-day lasting tan here.

This week, Zara recommended Kate Leaver's story on marriage in Future Women. Mich recommended you go see HUSTLERS at the cinema!

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Jan Fran</title>
      <description>HAPPY THURSDAY lovely people! Today on the show we are joined by the one and only Jan Fran. Of course, Jan Fran is an Australian journalist and presenter and presenter, best known for her work co-hosting SBS’ The Feed. Outside of that, though, Jan is also a bit of a podcast fiend, hosting The Few Who Do alongside Marc Fennell and having hosted Sexism and the City, too. Jan has shot and produced documentaries from all over the world, as well as occasionally appearing as a commentator on The Project Q&amp;A, ABC Breakfast, Paul Murray Live, Studio 10, The Latest, The Today Show and The Drum.

In this chat, we go everywhere from how Jan got her big break in the media, to what a diverse media landscape looks to her, and why her dream gig would be at the forefront of a late-night female-driven comedy show.

Thank you to our sponsor Bekka May for making today's episode possible. Find out more about Bekka May here and use our code 'SHAMELESS' at checkout for 10% off the their range.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Abbie Chatfield</title>
      <description>Hellooooo! Happy Thursday, lovely Shameless listeners!

Today we’re sitting down with Abbie Chatfield - the 24-year-old runner up on this year’s season of The Bachelor. We wouldn’t hop on a plane to Brisbane for just any Bachelor contestant; but we did for Abbie because we think her time in the public eye has been fascinating. Abbie is considered one of the most controversial Bachelor contestants in history for one, curious reason: Abbie likes talking about sex.

In this chat, we talk a lot about shame: why and how the media deploys it against women and the unique power in rejecting it.

If you loved this interview, follow Abbie on Instagram @abbiechatfield.

      <title>Erin Molan is not your punching bag</title>
      <description>Haaaaappy Monday, folks!

Coming up on today’s show: Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott split, and it’s a story not without a bunch of subplots. Plus, an explainer on the Erin Molan and Andrew Johns controversy (and how it exposes the NRL’s continued sexism problem) and the most ridiculous TV show on Australian television is The Masked Singer and we can’t stop talking about it.

This week, Zara recommended the book 'She Said'. Mich recommended Boy Swallows Universe because, yes, she is about 1000 years behind the curve.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Jo Weston</title>
      <description>Happy, happy, happy Thursday lovely people!

Today on the show we have the delightful Jo Weston. For those unaware, Jo is goal defence for the Australian Diamonds netball team, and has been a star of the Melbourne Vixens since she was basically a teenager.

Here, we talk to Jo all about what life is like as an athlete, how heartbreak and guilt overlap after a big loss and the work she thinks needs to be done in the space of women’s sport.

Jo is a total legend, and we think you will really love this chat.

Loved this? We think you'll also enjoy our chat with Brandon Jack, Edwina Bartholomew and Emma Hawkins.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Brandon Jack</title>
      <description>Haaaaappy Thursday, friends!

Please welcome THE FIRST EVER MAN to Shameless In Conversations! How wild. What a niche. For those unfamiliar, Brandon Jack was born with sporting prowess in his blood; Brandon grew up with a father, Garry, who was a star player and coach in the rugby league. His brother Kieren was an AFL premiership player, and for a time was captain of the Sydney Swans. Brandon gave professional sport a crack himself - he played alongside Kieren at Sydney from 2013 to 2017 - before deciding his passion was writing. And feminist writing, at that.

Now, Brandon is a columnist for the Sydney Morning Herald, where he writes about locker-room culture, feminism, and violence against women, among other things like current affairs and sport. We hope you enjoy this chat as much as we loved having it.

Follow Brandon on Instagram @brandonjackk. Find some of his writing here.

Loved this? We think you'll also enjoy our chat with writers Jamila Rizvi and Carly Findlay.

Craving more? You’re only human. Join our glorious Shameless Facebook community, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you chuck us a follow on Instagram instead?

        <![CDATA[<p>Haaaaappy Thursday, friends!</p><p><br></p><p>Please welcome THE FIRST EVER MAN to Shameless In Conversations! How wild. What a niche. For those unfamiliar, Brandon Jack was born with sporting prowess in his blood; Brandon grew up with a father, Garry, who was a star player and coach in the rugby league. His brother Kieren was an AFL premiership player, and for a time was captain of the Sydney Swans. Brandon gave professional sport a crack himself - he played alongside Kieren at Sydney from 2013 to 2017 - before deciding his passion was writing. And feminist writing, at that.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, Brandon is a columnist for the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em>, where he writes about locker-room culture, feminism, and violence against women, among other things like current affairs and sport. We hope you enjoy this chat as much as we loved having it.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Brandon on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brandonjackk/">@brandonjackk</a>.

      <title>A Survivor GoFundMe</title>
      <description>HIYA! Happy Monday, lovely people.

Today's show is a biiiig one: How a Survivor contestant was the recipient of GoFundMe’s third biggest fundraiser ever, the Bachelor contestant with a suspiciously-timed weight-loss program and the influencer who sparked a racist furore this week.

Zara recommended following @thedailyaus on Instagram. Meanwhile, keep your eyes peeled on our socials for our charity merch! $10 from every tee will be going straight towards Sacred Heart Mission's Women's House.

Read 'Dear fellow white people: here's what to do when you're called racist' by Rebecca Hains.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Priya Serrao</title>
      <description>Hello! Happy Thursday!

Today we are joined by Miss Universe Australia, Priya Serrao, a woman who defies the mould of what constitutes a beauty queen. Priya is beautiful, yes, but it's her brain that we find most impressive: she has interned for the United Nations in developing countries, has a law degree under her belt, is a vocal force for greater diversity and representation in the media, and works toward enacting change via her day job in public policy.

If you enjoyed this chat as much as we did, follow Priya on Instagram @priyaserrao.

      <title>The bloodsport of hating Caroline Calloway</title>
      <description>It's a new week and we have a lot to talk about, pals!

Starting with Taylor Swift performing at the Melbourne Cup. Then, the Caroline Calloway saga that just won't die (with a lil recap for those of you who have no idea what any of that means), and the think piece about performative friendships that had us squealing in delight.

Zara recommended Will and Woody's video on depression for R U OK Day.
Mich recommended you listen to Unravel: Snowball.

Read The Cut's personal essay on Caroline Calloway here, and Mic's piece on performative friendship here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Jess Quinn</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday lovely Shameless fam! Today, we are joined by the remarkable Jess Quinn. When Jess was nine, her life was thrown into disarray by a cancer diagnosis. Within the year, she would lose all of her hair, and then, one of her legs. Now, Jess has turned her biggest hurdle into her biggest triumph - her career is built on the prosthetic limb she wears every day, helping her show her 180,000 Instagram followers that beauty comes in many different sizes and forms.

Here, we talk with the advocate and influencer about disability, resilience, diversity and inspiration. It’s a conversation that has stuck with us ever since we sat down in Jess’ Melbourne hotel room, and will continue to have an impact on us for a very long time.

If you loved Jess as much as we loved talking to her, you can catch her on Instagram here, and her petition is right here, ready to be signed!

      <itunes:summary>Happy Thursday lovely Shameless fam! Today, we are joined by the remarkable Jess Quinn. When Jess was nine, her life was thrown into disarray by a cancer diagnosis. Within the year, she would lose all of her hair, and then, one of her legs. Now, Jess has turned her biggest hurdle into her biggest triumph - her career is built on the prosthetic limb she wears every day, helping her show her 180,000 Instagram followers that beauty comes in many different sizes and forms.

Here, we talk with the advocate and influencer about disability, resilience, diversity and inspiration. It’s a conversation that has stuck with us ever since we sat down in Jess’ Melbourne hotel room, and will continue to have an impact on us for a very long time.

If you loved Jess as much as we loved talking to her, you can catch her on Instagram here, and her petition is right here, ready to be signed!

Craving more? You’re only human. Join our glorious Shameless Facebook community, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you chuck us a follow on Instagram instead?

We know you didn't ask, but yes of course we have a weekly newsletter! So glad you asked. You can subscribe here for recommendations, columns and more super fun things (yes, we clickbaited you and we don't regret a thing. NOT A DAMN THING).

If you’d like to support the show, we would like that very much. Hit ‘subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘follow’ on Spotify, and leave a review if you’re feeling especially generous. Then sit back and bask in our eternal, abundant love.

Your hosts are Zara McDonald (@zamcdonald) and Michelle Andrews (@michelleandrews1).

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Leigh Campbell</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday!

Today we are joined by the delightful Leigh Campbell. If we are talking expert voices in the beauty and lifestyle space, Leigh’s the ultimate go-to. You probably grew up reading her columns and insights in Cosmopolitan magazine, or, later on, in the Huffington Post Australia. Or, perhaps, you found Leigh not through her work as a journalist and editor, but as a blogger; last year, she penned the wildly popular series Treading Water about her experience with infertility and miscarriage.

Here, we chat with Leigh about work, guilt and grief, and what the last 12 months of her life have taught her about herself.

If you love Leigh as much as we do, follow her on Instagram @leighacampbell.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Cyan Ta’eed</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday friends!

We’re joined today by serial entrepreneur Cyan Ta’eed, who has gone from working out of her parents’ basement in 2006 to building a tech empire in her online design and photography hub, Envato.

Over the last couple of years, Cyan has directed her energy and efforts into Hey Tiger, an ethical chocolate brand that functions as a social enterprise, where each bar sold helps community development projects for cocoa farming communities in West Africa.

Cyan is incredibly successful, yes, but she’s also kind, and oozes compassion with everything she does. Here, we discuss how she went from being in her mid-twenties with nothing to her name, to being in her late thirties with hundreds of employees, and everything in between. 

Want more from Cyan? Follow her on Instagram @cyanctaeed.

Craving more? You’re only human. Join our glorious Shameless Facebook community, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you chuck us a follow on Instagram instead?

We know you didn't ask, but yes of course we have a weekly newsletter! So glad you asked. You can subscribe here for recommendations, columns and more super fun things (yes, we clickbaited you and we don't regret a thing. NOT A DAMN THING).

Shameless Podcast is very much an independent vehicle that runs on the support of our incredible listeners - that's you! So, if you’d like to support the show, we would like that very much. Hit ‘subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘follow’ on Spotify, and leave a review if you’re feeling especially generous. Then sit back and bask in our eternal, abundant love.

      <itunes:summary>Happy Thursday friends!

We’re joined today by serial entrepreneur Cyan Ta’eed, who has gone from working out of her parents’ basement in 2006 to building a tech empire in her online design and photography hub, Envato.

Over the last couple of years, Cyan has directed her energy and efforts into Hey Tiger, an ethical chocolate brand that functions as a social enterprise, where each bar sold helps community development projects for cocoa farming communities in West Africa.

Cyan is incredibly successful, yes, but she’s also kind, and oozes compassion with everything she does. Here, we discuss how she went from being in her mid-twenties with nothing to her name, to being in her late thirties with hundreds of employees, and everything in between. 

Want more from Cyan? Follow her on Instagram @cyanctaeed.

Craving more? You’re only human. Join our glorious Shameless Facebook community, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you chuck us a follow on Instagram instead?

We know you didn't ask, but yes of course we have a weekly newsletter! So glad you asked. You can subscribe here for recommendations, columns and more super fun things (yes, we clickbaited you and we don't regret a thing. NOT A DAMN THING).

Shameless Podcast is very much an independent vehicle that runs on the support of our incredible listeners - that's you! So, if you’d like to support the show, we would like that very much. Hit ‘subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts or ‘follow’ on Spotify, and leave a review if you’re feeling especially generous. Then sit back and bask in our eternal, abundant love.

Your hosts are Zara McDonald (@zamcdonald) and Michelle Andrews (@michelleandrews1).

      <title>The unruly rebellion of Miley Cyrus</title>
      <description>Hi friends! Happy new week! What a time to be alive! We're almost at the end of winter, HOORAY!

Coming up on today's show: the sneaky new way to buy Instagram followers. Plus, how the royal family became embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein saga, and why the media finds Miley Cyrus so goddamn difficult.

This week Mich recommended Sam Cavanagh's interview with the Daily Talk Show boys. Listen here.

We'd give you Zara's recommendation, but it's kinda... not a thing. It's not a thing whatsoever.

Craving more? We thought you might be! Join our glorious Shameless Facebook community here, where thousands of like-minded ladies keep each other up to date with the latest celebrity and pop culture stories. Or if Facebook isn't your thing why don't you follow us on Instagram here instead?

We know you didn't ask, but yes of course we have a weekly newsletter! So glad you asked. You can subscribe to it here for recommendations, columns and more super fun things (yes, we clickbaited you and we don't regret a thing. NOT A DAMN THING). 

Your hosts are Zara McDonald (@zamcdonald) and Michelle Andrews (@michelleandrews1).

Thank you to our sponsor Thankyou for making today's episode possible. Find out more about the new Sage and Clare collaboration here.

      <title>Shredding for the wedding</title>
      <description>Happy Monday wonderful people!

Coming up on today’s episode: the influencer who ended her career by uploading the wrong Youtube video. Plus, the New York Times wants you to get “strong” for your wedding day, but by “strong” we’re pretty sure they mean “skinny”. Also, what’s with all these television reboots?

Zara recommended this episode of ABC's Conversations with Richard Fidler: https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/conversations/adele-ferguson-exposing-the-banks/11368384

If you love Polly as much as we do, find her on Instagram @pjdeeday. We are @shamelesspodcast!

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Georgie Dent</title>
      <description>Today on the show we have the warm, generous and stupidly clever Georgie Dent. Georgie is a former lawyer, a journalist, an old editor of ours and the author of the new and best-selling memoir, Breaking Badly.

At 24, things were going pretty good for Georgie. She’d landed a job at a prestigious Sydney law firm, was living with her boyfriend and had so much head of her. But, in her own words, she broke. By 25, Georgie was unemployed, back living with her parents and suffering such crippling anxiety that she ended up in a psychiatric hospital.

To quote the book’s own blurb, Breaking Badly is the story of a nervous breakdown in slow motion.

      <itunes:summary>Today on the show we have the warm, generous and stupidly clever Georgie Dent. Georgie is a former lawyer, a journalist, an old editor of ours and the author of the new and best-selling memoir, Breaking Badly.

At 24, things were going pretty good for Georgie. She’d landed a job at a prestigious Sydney law firm, was living with her boyfriend and had so much head of her. But, in her own words, she broke. By 25, Georgie was unemployed, back living with her parents and suffering such crippling anxiety that she ended up in a psychiatric hospital.

To quote the book’s own blurb, Breaking Badly is the story of a nervous breakdown in slow motion.

This is Georgie's story.

      <title>Complicated celebrity comebacks</title>
      <description>Heya! On today's show: Rebecca Black is officially back and so is Aziz Ansari. And later, how do we feel about women photoshopping their bodies to be larger than they are?

Zara recommends Uroll.Me and Mich recommends listening to Extremes by Vice.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Em Rusciano</title>
      <description>Today's In Conversation episode is with one firecracker of a human, Em Rusciano.

We adore Em for her wit and intelligence, but most of all her honesty and vulnerability. She is one of a kind and we hope you enjoy this chat about career, family and life in the public eye. Oh, and a note before we dive in - Em talks with her hands, which means you might hear some noises here and there! Just pretend you’re right there in the studio with us!

If you adore Em as much as we do, follow her on Instagram @emrusciano. You’ll find us at @shamelesspodcast!

You can also check out tickets for her new show, Rage and Rainbows, here.</description>

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Brooke Blurton</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday!

Today on the show we have the very lovely, very bubbly, Brooke Blurton. You may remember Brooke from her time on The Bachelor and The Bachelor in Paradise, but in truth, Brooke’s story is about far more than her short foray on reality TV.

Our conversation covers her childhood, her identity and her love of her job as a youth worker.

If you love Brooke as much as we do, find her on Instagram @brooke.blurton. We are @shamelesspodcast!

      <description>Happy Monday, Shameless family!

      <description>WE BAAAAAAACK. It's been a two-week break but it feels like a lifetime lovely people. So, what's on the agenda today? How a couple of former AFL Footballers proved exactly why this podcast exists, the accusations that Taylor Swift is co-opting the gay rights movement and why the hell hummus and Keanu Reeves have gone viral.

Mich recommends Breaking Badly by Georgie Dent and Zara recommends More Than Enough by Elaine Welteroth.

On today’s show: why do we care so much about Kim Kardashian’s spelling mistakes? Plus, the rise and rise of astrology amongst young women, and why an airplane flight and plate of beef has seen Emma Thompson be labelled a “first class hypocrite”.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Kate Wasley</title>
      <description>Happy Thursday you Shameless humans! On the show today we have the legend that is Kate Wasley. You might know Kate from her time as one half of AnyBody.co, a movement she co-founded that encouraged women to brace their bodies, no matter the size. As an in-demand model and influencer herself, Kate has graced the coveted pages of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition in 2018.

But perhaps her most important role is the one she plays in our conversations about body image online. We caught up with Kate on her latest trip to Melbourne where, in her hotel room with her best friend Tahlia by her said, she proved - through kindness and no bullshit - how she’s built the career she has.

You can follow Kate on Instagram here.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: The Veronicas</title>
      <description>Hello Shameless family!

Today we are joined by the powerhouses that make up The Veronicas - arguably Australia’s most recognisable female band. We caught up with twin sisters Jess and Lisa Origliasso in Brunswick to chat about the meaning behind their new hit single, Think Of Me, and what it’s like to become very very famous when you’re just teenagers.

Thanks so much to today's sponsors, Forever New, for making this episode possible.

We caught up with twin sisters Jess and Lisa Origliasso in Brunswick to chat about the meaning behind their new hit single, Think Of Me, and what it’s like to become very very famous when you’re just teenagers.

Thanks so much to today's sponsors, Forever New, for making this episode possible.

      <description>Monday fam! Hello! Welcome back.

On today’s show: Justin Bieber's strange defence of Chris Brown, The Sports Illustrated shoot that sparked quite a conversation in our Facebook group and the proliferation of cancel culture: Why don’t we ever let people muck up without demanding they die?

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Laura Byrne</title>
      <description>This week on the show, we are joined by the absolutely delightful Laura Byrne.

You might remember Laura from her time on The Bachelor, where she won Matty J’s heart and the affection of the country, too. Outside of reality television though, Laura runs Toni May, a jewellery company full of hand-crafted pieces that started selling at markets for a fun outside of her day job.

We meet a lot of people in this job, but we have to say, Laura is one of the kindest, warmest, most down to earth women we’ve had the pleasure of chatting to. We caught up with her in Sydney not long ago - just before she got engaged!!! - to talk all things love, business, miscarriage and pregnancy.

You can follow Laura at @ladyandacat on Instagram.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Natalie Fornasier</title>
      <description>Today, we are joined by a person who has influenced Zara and I more than any “Instagram influencer” or “YouTube vlogger” ever has. Her name is Natalie Fornasier, and she has 839 Instagram followers. Your eyebrows might be raised right now, and you might be wondering how a normal Sydney girl with a normal social media following could be so influential.

Well, last year, Natalie sat down with Byrdie.com.au for a story titled “I’m 24 and Living With Advanced Melanoma—This Is My Story”. Natalie’s words and insights in that interview were what informed our very last segment of Shameless in 2018, and what pushed Zara to change her own relationship with sun tanning forever.

Today, we sit down with Natalie, who is now 25, but still grappling with her stage four cancer diagnosis. We talk about friends, finding love, and what you can do to spread the word.

We have chosen to forgo an episode sponsor today, and have dedicated the episode to Call Time On Melanoma.

To support Call Time On Melanoma, visit www.calltimeonmelanoma.com.au, or follow them on Instagram @calltimeonmelanoma.

On today's show: the Queen of PR might be getting her own reality TV show. Plus, we get into the nitty gritty of the Influencer Olympics, otherwise known as Coachella, and the machinations of why Lara Bingle was slut-shamed out of the country.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Rowi Singh</title>
      <description>Happy In Conversation Thursday lovely people! On today's show, we are joined with Rowi Singh. It’s hard to condense what and who Rowi is in a quick soundbite, but we will give it a shot.

Rowi is an influencer, yes, but she’s not your average influencer. She might have more than a hundred thousand followers on Instagram, but she’s not about detox teas and teeth whitener. Instead, Rowi’s brand is her creativity. She’s a wildly talented makeup artist, who bluntly refuses to colour inside any of the lines. She’s also a proud Punjabi woman who is ready to call time on cultural appropriation, who is never afraid to embrace colour, and is unapologetic in both her feminism and her femininity.

This chat is political and candid and vivacious - just like the woman you see on Instagram and YouTube.

We hope you enjoy!

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: DJ Tigerlily</title>
      <description>Haaaaappy Thursday friends! Wow, do we have a treat for you today.

If you’ve ever been to a nightclub, or a music festival, the chances are you know the name, but perhaps you don’t know the story behind one of our country’s most successful musical exports.

In this chat, we explore who DJ Tigerlily is - yes - but we also get to know Dara Hayes, the woman behind the elaborate wigs and costumes.

      <itunes:summary>Haaaaappy Thursday friends! Wow, do we have a treat for you today.

If you’ve ever been to a nightclub, or a music festival, the chances are you know the name, but perhaps you don’t know the story behind one of our country’s most successful musical exports.

In this chat, we explore who DJ Tigerlily is - yes - but we also get to know Dara Hayes, the woman behind the elaborate wigs and costumes. You’ll find that Dara, the 27-year-old who lives with her boyfriend and their one-year-old Groodle, is enigmatic; a refreshing blend of passion, charm, and honesty.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Effie Kats</title>
      <description>Today we are joined by the force of nature that is Effie Kats. For those unfamiliar, Effie is a design powerhouse. She’s the brains behind her self-titled bespoke suiting brand, as well as Bayse Brand for perfectly cut basics and Dead End Lovers, the home of gorgeous jewellery.

But the road to here wasn’t an easy one. At 23, she created cult brand Zachary The Label. Four years later, she lost everything.

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Tully Smyth</title>
      <description>If you don’t know Tully Smyth by name, we will bet you know her story. Rising to fast fame on Big Brother, Smyth found herself the centre of one of the original international and viral storms, after entering into a relationship with a fellow contestant while still having a girlfriend on the outside. Some six years later, Tully Smyth has proved to be far more than her Big Brother story. She is now an influencer, a content creator, a vocal advocate for mental health and people suffering from early onset Alzheimer's. Tully knows how to tell a story, and we can’t wait for you to hear the ones she has to tell today.

You can follow Tully on Instagram @tee_smyth and us @shamelesspocast. Enjoy!</description>

      <title>IN CONVERSATION: Carly Findlay</title>
      <description>Most people would introduce Carly as a disability advocate, and they'd be right, but she’s also so much more than that: she’s an author, a podcaster, and a generally wonderful human being. In this chat, which took place in the very trendy suburb of Brunswick, we talk about friendships and loneliness, what it's like to bump into your school bully, and the people who try to "cure" her genetic condition.

Buy Carly's marvellous new book Say Hello (really, it's amazing, do it right now) right here: https://www.booktopia.com.au/say-hello-carly-findlay/prod9781460755037.html

Follow Carly on Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/carlyfindlay/?hl=en

And on Twitter here: https://twitter.com/carlyfindlay/

Until Monday, friends!

      <description>Guess who's back, back again. We are back. Don't tell Zara I wrote this.

Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back.

YEP! It's 2019 and we are keen to talk about a few things, like: Why is Em Rusciano mad? What in the WHAT is a v-string bikini? Does mummy blogging cross the line? And did Kendall Jenner just save the world with a Proactiv ad? (Hint for that last one: no.)

Em Rusciano's interview with Offspring is here.
Bianca O'Neill on Beginning Boutique and body diversity is here.
Mich's review of the v-string bikini will be posted in our FB group when it goes live. Join here.
Christie Tate for the Washington Post is here, while Pandora Syke's column is here. We also talked about Darlena Cunha's writing for Sydney Morning Herald and Elizabeth Bastos for New York Times.
And, finally, click here for Danielle Young's take on bad publicity and the Kardashians.

That's all for now! We will be dropping our In Conversation episode on Thursday. Until then, subscribe to our newsletter or follow us on Insta! BYE xxxxxx

      <title>Inside the Birdcage</title>
      <description>Oh my goodness WHAT A WEEK!

On this episode we're covering the bachelorettes who can't help but spread dangerous health advice, whether or not the Melbourne Cup Carnival is unethical (and our experience in the Birdcage) and, finally, the Victoria's Secret Catwalk.

RECOMMENDATIONS: This week, Mich recommended this episode of the The Tim Ferriss Show podcast with Seth Godin. Zara recommended the fiction book Normal People by Sally Rooney.

Oh, and we are launching a RECOMMENDATIONS NEWSLETTER. Weeeee. You can subscribe to that right here. If that link doesn't work (damn podcast app) head over to our Insta bio @shamelesspodcast - we will also put the link there.

Again, here is the fantastic piece on reaction culture written by Man Repeller's Haley Nahman.

So if you love Shameless and want to help us grow, you can do a few things: The first is click ‘subscribe’ on Apple Podcasts, that helps new listeners find our show every week..

      <title>The psychology of hate-following</title>
      <description>HAPPY MONDAY wonderful humans, boy do we have a show for you today.

First, we need to talk about J-Lo and that glittery green cape. Then, Charlie-Sheen-related-frustration makes Mich cry, and we look at the phenomenon of hate-following.

The piece Zara recommended on outrage culture is here.
The No Filter episode about James Packer's life is here.
The Cut on Tuesdays' episode on extremism is here.
Listen to Tim Ferriss in conversation with Karlie Kloss here.

God this is gonna be a lotta links. Bear with us.

ALRIGHTY.

The New York Times' Anna Holmes on Charlie Sheen's misogyny.
Vanity Fair's 2011 Charlie Sheen profile (written by Mark Seal).
Tom Meagher's sentiment on Charlie Sheen's Australian visa is here.

Then we've got Rachel Siemens for Man Repeller on hate-following.
Sophie Wilkinson for Grazia on the same topic.
And, last but not least, Vice on why it might not be all that bad for us.

Thanks to Lou Lou Lips for making this episode of Shameless possible. Episode 34 was produced by Michelle Andrews, with royalty-free music from BenSound.

For anyone who is still reading and is therefore a VIP listener, thank you, thank you, thank you. You make our jobs a true joy and we couldn't do any of this without you x</description>

      <title>The. Worst. Bachelor. Ever.</title>
      <description>Good morning to everyone except Nick Cummins!

Kidding, kidding. In all seriousness, though, what the HECK happened on The Bachelor last week? Plus, can you be a feminist and love rap music, and what's with the return of the noughties' biggest Hollywood stars? Mischa Barton and Lindsay Lohan are ev-er-y-where.

Our recommendations for the week: How To Be Perfect by Holly Wainwright and Nine Perfect Strangers by Liane Moriarty.

      <title>It’s time to talk about the Bachelor villains</title>
      <description>Hola! On this week's show: Did Chrissy Teigen finally give us an opportunity to talk about drinking alcohol in excess, the women whose reputations are ruined by their tenure on reality television and Cosmopolitan cover that’s generated more discussion than almost any other cover this year.

You can find Sali Hughes piece about the Tess Holliday cover here, and Wil Anderson's conversation with Jules Lund here.

We can't tell you how much that helps us spread the word and grow our little baby pod. Thanks for always being so lovely and supportive.

      <title>The celebrity guide to splitting up</title>
      <description>It's Monday morning and while that means the weekly grind is churning again, we're happy to ease the pain with another episode.

On this week's show: Why everyone’s getting sick of The Bachelor, what on Earth do we do with men in the public eye who have fucked up, and the breakup statements so saccharine we feel a little queasy.

You can read Clementine Ford's piece on Louis C.K here, Dana Schwartz's piece on the same topic here and Tom Meagher's piece on the monster myth here. Also, here's Lena Dunham's column on break ups for Vogue.

      <title>The tear-down of Tammy Hembrow</title>
      <description>Heyo! It's Monday. Happy Monday!

It's a big show for you and it starts where it obviously should: Is this year's Bachelor a tiny bit problematic? Mich says no, Zara says maybe. We also debrief on Four Corner's brilliant investigation in cosmetic surgery and influencers, and the subsequent response of our country's biggest beauty bloggers to the furore. If you're interested in watching, check it out here. Plus, the story that put Tammy Hembrow on the international stage this week - and not in a good way.

As always, you're so welcome to join the conversation in our Facebook group! Otherwise, you can follow Michelle on Instagram here, Zara on Instagram here or get in touch at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.

OH and we’re on Instagram now, too. Follow us here.

We're a tiny, little independent podcast who rely on YOU GUYS so others can find us. If you have the time, we'd love it if you could subscribe to the show.

      <title>Sam, Tara and messy public break ups</title>
      <description>Happy Monday!

Of course, it wouldn't be a recap of this week without a pretty comprehensive about one of the ugliest reality TV break ups in recent memory: What is it about these allegations of emotional and physical abuse that make us so uncomfortable?

Plus, the messy, messy divorce between Brad and Angelina escalated this week as both leaked like crazy. Oh, and are anonymous gossip Instagram accounts good for the world or an exercise in bullying?

If you're interested, here's the piece Zara mentioned on male privilege and violence on the podcast: http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/challenging-the-mra-claim-of-a-domestic-violence-conspiracy/8632190

      <title>A message for wellness warriors</title>
      <description>Guess what! We back! After a month off regular programming, we've resumed our normal eps and woweeeee did we have some things to discuss.

Yes, once again, it's time to chat about wellness warriors and dangerous messages of some of the most influential. Plus, the moment Channel 10 inadvertently told a country of women they just weren't very funny and how the response to Demi Lovato's reported overdose shines a harsh light on how we consider celebrity addiction.

You can read Jane Caro's piece on women in Australian comedy here, Benjamin Law's piece on Lee Lin Chin here, watch Amy here and read the NYT profile on Gwyneth Paltrow here.

      <title>The evolution of Steph Claire Smith</title>
      <description>Steph Claire Smith is well-known for her presence on Instagram, but how has her approach to the platform changed as her following has boomed? We get her onto the show to ask her about the finite details of a social media presence that demands engagement of young girls.

      <title>Kate Spade and clickbait culture</title>
      <description>Hello listener friends!
Coming up on today's show: How did the media do in handling the tragic suicide of Kate Spade? The coverage was pretty deplorable if you ask us. Plus, does Miss America dumping the swimsuit section from their competitions mean pageants are feminist? AND we really need to deep dive into the strange underground world of female fitness influencers injecting themselves with steroids.
If you would like to skip our segment on Kate Spade and suicide, please pick back up at 35m 15s. Help is always available at Lifeline on 13 11 14.
Click here for Guy Raz's interview with Kate Spade on How I Built This.
And here for Zara's Mamamia.com.au story on celebrities and mental health.
Aaaaand here for Jordan Camilla's YouTube video on PED culture amongst Instagram influencers.

      <title>Gotta sign that NDA</title>
      <description>Don't mess with celebrities and their clandestine sex lives; such was the message that come through this week, thanks to Love Island. Contestant Natasha not-so-subtly hinted to spending "two nights" with old mate Justin Bieber, but she'll be damned if she tells us much more. So what's the deal with water-tight NDAs around both sex and abuse?
Plus, Hugh Grant was married this week in a spectacularly low-key affair, so is he officially Britain's most reluctant celebrity? And of course, the crazy White House world welcoming Kim Kardashian into its throes. Send help. This is too much.
As mentioned in the show, you can read all about the scandalous history of celebrity NDAs here, and Hugh Grant's full statement to the Leveson inquiry here.

      <title>Love Island Australia is white. Too white</title>
      <description>In case you missed it, 2Day FM radio star Em Rusciano isn't here to be meek and mild. The presenter and comedian has been at the centre of a media storm this week, and we can't help but feel like the entire debacle is a little bit gendered.

We also dive into what Love Island Australia will be like (... can we have just a TINY BIT of diversity, please?) and Johnny Depp's career, two years after he was accused of domestic violence against Amber Heard.
Read/hear the New York Times' interview with the cast of Arrested Development here.
The Sydney Morning Herald's scathing (and questionable) portrayal of Em Rusciano is here.
Are you a member of our Shameless Celebrity Gossip Facebook group yet? If not, GET IN THERE. It's like the sisterhood of the travelling pants. Except with no pants. Just great chats.
You can find us on Instagram here. Zara keeps telling everyone about that time I was on The Daily Mail for being "extremely intoxicated" and I don't appreciate it. Or, if you are shy/refuse to contribute to Zuckerberg's rise to global domination, email us at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING, YOUR SUPPORT MEANS THE WORLD. We still can't believe how supportive and lovely you have all been. Thank you, thank you, thank you.
I'm going to stop being gushy and embarrassing now.

      <title>It's a royal wedding extravaganza</title>
      <description>It’s like Christmas, but better (!!!) with fashion and weddings and grandeur and tabloid drama.
Yes, it’s royal wedding week and we’ll be damned if we aren’t spending (almost) the whole show on it. From the Great Markle Debacle to the dress of the century to the aisle walk that demanded more headlines than the wedding itself: We go deep and wide and, well, everywhere.
Plus, Kim Kardashian’s sucky (ha) Instagram post that landed her in a boiling pot of hot water. Silly, Kim.
You can find the cringe Ryan Seacrest moment here, listen to Wil Anderson’s interview with Em Rusciano here and read the Jezebel piece on Kim Kardashian’s dangerous post here.
As always, you're so welcome to join the conversation in our Facebook group! Otherwise, you can find us on Twitter, follow Michelle on Instagram here, Zara on Instagram here or get in touch at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.
Oh oh oh oh and we’re on Instagram now, too. Follow us here.

      <title>Fact checking a "healing princess"</title>
      <description>It’s episode 9! Bloody hell, doesn’t time fly?
This week we have a little chat on the announcement of Ali Oetjen as Australia’s newest Bachelorette and our… mixed feelings about it.
Also, the problematic wellness influencer who says she treated her precancerous cells naturally, and the glittery phenomenon that is dubbed “the party of the year”, the MET gala.

UPDATE: After recording this episode we also received a statement from Dr Brad McKay, a family doctor from East Sydney Doctors, about Sarah Stevenson's claims. He told us:
"Promoting a healthy lifestyle is admirable, but believing you’ve healed your cervical dysplasia “naturally” is not grounded in reality... "Your immune system is extremely complex and you really don’t have much control over it. It’s narcissistic to believe that you can heal your cervix with positive thoughts and green smoothies... Declaring that you’ve healed your cervix “naturally” is not only ignorant, but it’s also insulting to those people who have been diagnosed with cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer. It implies that if you require treatment you haven’t prayed hard enough, haven’t thought positively enough, or haven’t eaten the right nutritional supplement. Sometimes bad things happen and it’s not helpful or accurate to play a blame game... "I’m glad to hear that her high grade cervical lesion is now a low grade lesion, but it’s dangerous to recommend others follow a “CIN3 routine” based on her anecdotal experience."
As always, you're so welcome to join the conversation in our Facebook group! Otherwise, you can find us on Twitter, follow Michelle on Instagram here, Zara on Instagram here or get in touch at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.
And before we go: We're a tiny, little independent podcast who rely on YOU GUYS so others can find us. If you have the time, we'd love it if you could subscribe to the show.

      <title>The making of a reality TV villain</title>
      <description>HEY. Welcome back! We’re so happy to have you here.
We’re going just a liiiiiiittle bit rogue this week and changing things up. Yeeeep, we’re interviewing former Bachelor star Jen Hawke - also known as Australia’s favourite reality TV villain - about the power of the producer. Can a reality TV producer create a villain, we ask her, or do they need something to actually play with in order to craft their character?
PLUS, fashion blogger Gary Pepper Girl published the intricate details of her wedding prep on Into The Gloss and wowee do we have some thoughts and feelings to unpack. 
If you’re interested in checking out some of the articles we pointed to in the show, you can here:


Amanda Sherker on the 7 Ways The Beauty Industry Convinced Women That They Weren't Good Enough for The Huffington Post.



Jia Tolentino on The Year That Skin Care Became a Coping Mechanism for The New Yorker.



Caitlin Fitzsimmons on how much Australians really spend on their weddings for the Sydney Morning Herald.


You're so welcome to join the conversation in our Facebook group! Otherwise, you can find us on Twitter, follow Michelle on Instagram here, Zara on Instagram here or get in touch at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.
And before we go: We're a tiny, little independent podcast who rely on your reviews for others to find us. If you have the time, we'd love it if you could leave us a review and we promise we will pay you back. One day. Maybe. Somehow.

      <title>Going deep on Khloe Kardashian and 'Third Trimester Tristan'</title>
      <description>OH MY GOODNESS. This week we obviously needed to debrief on the Khloe Kardashian/Tristan Thompson cheating saga. We went deeeeeep (and got a little fiery with each other along the way) on how much sympathy should we have for Khloe, and the men like Tristan who just can’t keep it in their pants.
Also: we cover the cultural phenomenon that is Coachella, and the musical phenomenon that is Cardi B.
Zara referenced a heaaaaap of stuff today that she read about Cardi B this week: You can try the GQ profile here, The Guardian profile here, the Pitchfork piece here on why her number one matters and the Splinter News piece here about Cardi B, Taylor Swift and race relations in Trump's America.
You're so welcome to join the conversation in our Facebook group! Otherwise, you can find us on Twitter, Mich on Insta here and Zara on Insta here. OR get in touch at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.
And before we go: We're a tiny independent podcast so we would love it if you could leave us a review so other people can stumble on our show.

      <title>Celebrity divorce and the great Instagram lie</title>
      <description>Well, it’s been a big week in the world of celebrity divorce after Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum announced their “loving” split to the cries of love being dead. So why is it we feel so viscerally about break-ups like this? Is it because we feel we’ve being sold a lie about what a relationship and a break up looks like?
Plus, a radio host’s orgasm story that was a little bit too much to stomach and the atrocity that is Meghan Markle daring to have a grey hair.
Zara recommended two pieces from Man Repeller this week, one on love and the beauty of its dullness which you can find here, and another on the concept of a friendship complex which you can find here.
If you’re also willing to give Marie Claire a click for that atrocious grey hair article, you can right here. (But don’t tell them we sent you.) And if you haven’t read it, or it’s been a while, check out the history-making Vanity Fair profile of Meghan Markle here.
You're so welcome to join the conversation in our Facebook group! Otherwise, you can find us on Twitter, Mich on Insta here and Zara on Insta here. OR get in touch at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.
And before we go: We're a tiny independent podcast so we would love it if you could leave us a review so other people can stumble on our show.

      <description>HELLO! This week we're doing things a little differently - we're interviewing Georgia Love! The journalist and former Bachelorette issued a blistering tweet to a women's tabloid mag this week, so we had a chat with her about it. Also, we need to get to the bottom of why a celebrity BIT BEYONCE ON THE FACE and whether or not it's creepy for Scott Disick to be dating a teenager.

      <title>Oops! Britney did it again. And again</title>
      <description>HOLA! Welcome back.
Bachelor in Paradise started this week, so naturally, we took it upon ourselves to debrief all about the show's premiere. Michelle thinks Davey and Flo will be the first to have sex, Zara thinks she's wrong and mostly, we talk a whole lot of crap about a show that's just a whole lot of crap. Loveable crap, that is.
We also deep-dive the return of Britney Spears - considering she randomly re-surfaced in our news cycle TWICE this week - and discuss the media's troubling response to a story about Robin Williams and his larrikin antics on the set of Mork &amp; Mindy. Can we call it sexual harassment when it's not, by definition, sexual harassment?
Feel free to come and join the conversation in our Facebook group! Search 'Shameless celebrity gossip' and join the fun. Otherwise, you can find us on Twitter @shameless_pod or get in touch at shamelessthepodcast@gmail.com.

And before we go: We're a tiny, little independent podcast so we would love it if you could leave us a review so other people can stumble on our show. We would love your love.

      <description>Oh hey there! This week, we just needed to debrief about the kiss that landed Katy Perry in some rather hot water, the WAGs who build their careers off the back of heartbreak, and the incredible resurgence of Jennifer Garner.

Speaking of Jen Garner, let us know what you think her quotes meant in this Vanity Fair profile: https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/02/jennifer-garner-talks-kids-career-ben-affleck

      <title>Fashion week is real life Instagram</title>
      <description>Ever wondered if Fashion Week is just a big wank fest? Michelle and Zara went down to VAMFF this week to check it all out, and Mich walked away with a few key concerns about the festival.

Plus, we deep-dive the months-long saga involving Ryan Seacrest and try to make sense of sexual misconduct allegations that are made public before they're proven. Oh, and do we have any right to know about Bella Hadid’s face? It feels like now more than ever plastic surgery is prevalent among our youngest and brightest stars. So what the hell do we make of it all?

If you're interested in a comprehensive explainer on Ryan Seacrest, Variety have done some great reporting on the issue: http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ryan-seacrest-sexual-abuse-allegations-stylist-details-1202710460/
