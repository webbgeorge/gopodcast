    <description>New episodes coming January 2025. Do you ever listen to a true crime podcast and think, “that’s not quite right…?” Same. Crime stories are hard to ignore and even harder to forget. But the thing is... they’re stories. And getting a story right is all about how you tell it. Truer Crime talks about real people— murdered, missing, misled — with more nuance, more context, and more questions. Hosted by Celisia Stanton.</description>

      <title>Alice Sebold / Anthony Broadwater</title>
      <description>You might know Alice Sebold from her bestselling novel “The Lovely Bones.” But before that, she became famous for her memoir “Lucky,” where she recounts the brutal assault she survived in a park near her college campus—and the trial that followed. The man convicted in that trial was Anthony Broadwater, who has maintained his innocence for more than 40 years. Today’s episode is about forgiveness, resilience, and the devastating consequences of getting it wrong.

Please be aware that today’s episode contains references to sexual assault and physical violence.

A full list of action items, sources, resources mentioned, and photos related to the case are available in the show notes of today's episode, https://truercrimepodcast.com/andthony-alice

      <title>The Assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</title>
      <description>On April 4, 1968, a single bullet ended the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The official story pinned the murder on James Earl Ray—a fugitive desperate to evade capture—but for decades, the King family has fought to expose a darker truth. In this episode, we uncover the buried evidence, tangled conspiracies, and a stunning 1999 civil trial that found the U.S. government complicit in King’s assassination. What does justice look like for one of history’s most celebrated heroes—and why is so much of this story still left untold?

Please note that today's episode includes language some listeners might find offensive as well as references to gun violence. Please take care while listening.

      <title>Tamla Horsford</title>
      <description>From 1920 to 1940, no Black people lived in Forsyth County, Georgia. None. But by the time Tamla Horsford moved there with her family, a lot had changed. Or so it seemed, until Tamla was found dead in the Fall of 2018. Suddenly, a century’s worth of trauma resurfaced in the once all-white Georgia county. Today’s episode reveals what happens when a woman and a county collide.

Please be aware that today’s episode references lynching and other racial violence. Please take care while listening.

      <title>Sam Mandez</title>
      <description>Sam Mandez was just 14 years old when his elderly neighbor, Frida Winter, was found murdered in her home, the same home Sam had painted with his grandfather just a few summers prior. It would be years before they set their eyes on Sam as their main suspect. And while he was just a kid when the crime took place, Sam was tried as an adult and eventually sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder. Despite maintaining his innocence, he now faced a future behind bars. But what would that future *actually* look like? Today, we’re starting where a lot of other true crime stories end – in prison. 

Please be aware that today’s episode discusses incarceration, solitary confinement, severe mental illness, suicide, and self-harm. Please take care while listening.

      <title>*BONUS* The Real Impacts of True Crime Media w/ Sarah Turney </title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/BONUS-The-Real-Impacts-of-True-Crime-Media-w-Sarah-Turney-e1p32pc</link>
      <description>In 2001, Sarah Turney’s sister, Alissa, went missing. Nearly two decades later and no arrests in the case, the police told her they could no longer help her and she needed to get media coverage for the case. So, in 2019, Sarah started The Voices for Justice Podcast as a way to tell Alissa’s story. In August 2020, an arrest was made in the case and Sarah’s efforts were recognized by the Maricopa County Attorney. Since the arrest, Sarah has shifted her focus to advocating for other cases in need of justice.
In today’s bonus interview, Sarah reflects on what she’s learned along the way, and answers critical questions from her own experience as both a victim’s family member and a true crime media creator herself. Why might a family member tell their story on a podcast with exploitative tendencies? How does Sarah create a safe space for victims and their family members to share their stories on Voices for Justice? What could ethical true crime content look like? And what can true crime media consumers do to push the genre into a more ethical direction?
I was so honored to learn from Sarah, and I hope you enjoy this bonus interview while we are on a break from regular season episodes.
You can find Sarah Turney on TikTok, Instagram and Twitter (@saraheturney). Make sure to also check out Sarah's podcasts Voices for Justice and Disappearances.

      <itunes:summary>In 2001, Sarah Turney’s sister, Alissa, went missing. Nearly two decades later and no arrests in the case, the police told her they could no longer help her and she needed to get media coverage for the case. So, in 2019, Sarah started The Voices for Justice Podcast as a way to tell Alissa’s story. In August 2020, an arrest was made in the case and Sarah’s efforts were recognized by the Maricopa County Attorney. Since the arrest, Sarah has shifted her focus to advocating for other cases in need of justice.
In today’s bonus interview, Sarah reflects on what she’s learned along the way, and answers critical questions from her own experience as both a victim’s family member and a true crime media creator herself. Why might a family member tell their story on a podcast with exploitative tendencies? How does Sarah create a safe space for victims and their family members to share their stories on Voices for Justice? What could ethical true crime content look like? And what can true crime media consumers do to push the genre into a more ethical direction?
I was so honored to learn from Sarah, and I hope you enjoy this bonus interview while we are on a break from regular season episodes.

      <title>*BONUS* Womanhood + True Crime w/ Olivia Gatwood</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/BONUS-Womanhood--True-Crime-w-Olivia-Gatwood-e18l7vi</link>
      <description>In 2017, Olivia Gatwood picked up a new hobby: listening to true crime podcasts. Living in a first floor Boston apartment at the time, Olivia was quickly consumed by a new fear: a man breaking into her apartment and murdering her in her sleep. In order to work through this fear, Olivia wrote about it in what would eventually become her poetry collection “Life of the Party.”
A conversation between Olivia and Celisia, today’s episode explores how warranted fear can become harmful paranoia, why so many women are obsessed with true crime, and what ‘justice’ looks like in a society obsessed with punishment.
You can find Olivia on Instagram @oliviagatwood
Check out Olivia's books Life of the Party and New American Best Friend.

      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/Ep--09-My-Story-e1404am</link>
      <description>Last week I sat in a courtroom, a government building not so different from the ones we often mention on Truer Crime. So this week I decided to do something different: In today’s episode, I’m both crime storyteller and crime victim. This is the story of how a man I trusted stole my entire life savings — and what I learned along the way.

      <title>Joan Little Pt. 1</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/Ep--08-Joan-Little-Pt--1-e13jrrf</link>
      <description>In the early hours of August 27th, 1974, the security camera at North Carolina’s Beaufort County Jail was inexplicably not working. So when the night jailer, Clarence Alligood is found dead in 20-year-old Joan Little’s cell — everyone is left with a slew of unanswered questions. Why was Clarence Alligood in Joan Little’s cell? What had led to his murder? And where was Joan Little?
Today’s episode explores a case that was too big and important to fit into one episode. The story continues with part 2 next Tuesday (July 6th).

      <title>Michael Johnson / Tiger Mandingo</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/Ep--07-Michael-Johnson--Tiger-Mandingo-e136rol</link>
      <description>In the winter of 2013, Dylan King-Lemons went to the doctor with stomach pains. His diagnosis? HIV. A few months later, one of his former sexual partners, Michael Johnson, is arrested. But why? Today’s episode explores identity, crime, and our societal obsession with punishment.
Please be aware that today’s episode contains references to anti-Black racism, homophobia, and incarceration.
*Correction: In the episode we mentioned St. Charles, Missouri has a Black population of less than 2%. This was an error. The most recent U.S. Census data shows that St. Charles County, Missouri has Black or African American population of 5.3%.

      <title>The Tulsa Race Massacre</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/Ep--06-The-Tulsa-Race-Massacre-e12p1h4</link>
      <description>In 1921, an act of terrorism would turn a once thriving Black community to ash and rubble overnight. It was an event so horrific that many historians now call it the single worst incident of racist violence in U.S. history. But what led up to that fateful day? And why were folks so intent to forget it ever happened? Today’s episode explores the importance of history and the ways violence can stretch — touching us all even a century later. 
Please be aware that today’s episode discusses anti-Black racist violence, murder, and sexual assault.

      <title>Josiah Sutton</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/Ep--04-Josiah-Sutton-e11uai4</link>
      <description>At just 16 years old, Josiah Sutton is accused and convicted of a heinous crime he swears he didn’t commit. Only problem? Investigators have DNA evidence which links him directly to the crime. Today’s episode explores forensic science, the effects of imprisonment, and the bond between a mother and her son. Today’s story contains references to sexual assault, incarceration, and very briefly, suicidal ideation. 
Please take care while listening. A special thank you to Josiah’s mom, Carol Batie for talking with us for this episode.

      <title>Jonestown</title>
      <link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/truer-crime/episodes/Ep--03-Jonestown-e11gsed</link>
      <description>In November of 1978, 918 Americans died in the middle of the Guyanese jungle. It would be “the largest single incident of civilian death in American history” until September 11th, 2001. But who were these people? How did they really die? And why were they in South America to begin with? It’s a story you may have heard before — but maybe never quite like this. 
Today's story contains references to suicide and mass death. Please take care while listening.
