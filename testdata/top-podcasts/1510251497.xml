      <title>S7 EP36: Adam Kay </title>
      <description>Joining us this episode to discuss the highs and lows of parenting (and life) is the brilliant writer, author, comedian and former doctor - Adam Kay. Adam is best known as author of the number-one bestselling book ‘This Is Going to Hurt’.

His new book KAY’S INCREDIBLE INVENTIONS is available now.
In the latest laugh-out-loud book from the record-breaking Adam Kay and Henry Paker, you’ll learn about everything ever invented, from the daft to the disgusting to the downright dangerous. You’ll discover all about the queen who pooed on the first ever toilet, how velcro was invented by a dog and why the Ancient Greeks wiped their bums on dinner plates, as well as 48,762,851,208 other facts. (Approximately.)

Illustrated by Henry Paker, friend and fellow comedian, who has worked on all Adam’s bestselling children’s books, Kay’s Incredible Inventions is funny and factual, written with the UK's Key Stage 2 science and history curriculum very much in mind, and is destined to inspire the next generation of scientists and inventors. Just like Kay's Marvellous Medicine and Kay's Anatomy, Kay's Incredible Inventions offers wonderfully gross and wonderfully funny entertainment. It offers fun first but also education by stealth.

      <description>We’ve got a very special Valentine’s Day exclusive episode for you… ❤️💔

Yes, you spoke and we listened, and the guest on the show today is none other than Lou Beckett with a right to reply on some of the things Rob has said on the podcast recently (in particular his time in charge of the kids while she was in New York 🗽 🇺🇸)
(And keep an eye out for Rose and her response to Josh’s escapades coming soon)

Thanks, Rob + Josh.

BIG NEWS.... we're writing a book! 

⭐ All the stories we can’t tell on the podcast – in depth.

⭐ What it’s like to raise a stiff neck and a loose neck – straight from the horse’s mouth (our parents)

⭐ And.. the BIGGEST REQUEST WE’VE EVER HAD FOR THE PODCAST… Hearing from our wives, Rose &amp; Lou. They’ve got a chapter each and YOU can submit your burning questions to them...   PARENTINGHELLBOOK@BONNIERBOOKS.CO.UK

What's it really like to be a parent? And how come no one ever warned Rob or Josh of the sheer mind-bending, world-altering, sleep-depriving, sick-covering, tear-inducing, snot-wiping, bore-inspiring, 4am-relationship-straining brutality of it all? And if they did, why can't they remember it (or remember anything else, for that matter)?

And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?

Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.

Find out everything you need to know, including how you could win a pair of tickets to the Parenting Hell LIVE tour &amp; an overnight stay in London here:

And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?

Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.

And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?

Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.

BIG NEWS.... we're writing a book! 

⭐ All the stories we can’t tell on the podcast – in depth.

⭐ What it’s like to raise a stiff neck and a loose neck – straight from the horse’s mouth (our parents)

⭐ And.. the BIGGEST REQUEST WE’VE EVER HAD FOR THE PODCAST… Hearing from our wives, Rose &amp; Lou. They’ve got a chapter each and YOU can submit your burning questions to them...   PARENTINGHELLBOOK@BONNIERBOOKS.CO.UK

What's it really like to be a parent? And how come no one ever warned Rob or Josh of the sheer mind-bending, world-altering, sleep-depriving, sick-covering, tear-inducing, snot-wiping, bore-inspiring, 4am-relationship-straining brutality of it all? And if they did, why can't they remember it (or remember anything else, for that matter)?

And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?

Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.

Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.

What's it really like to be a parent? And how come no one ever warned Rob or Josh of the sheer mind-bending, world-altering, sleep-depriving, sick-covering, tear-inducing, snot-wiping, bore-inspiring, 4am-relationship-straining brutality of it all? And if they did, why can't they remember it (or remember anything else, for that matter)?

And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?

Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.

      <description>S04 EP46: The Fact Monster Has Arrived(Apologies for the late release of this episode, producer Michael had his luggage go M.I.A. somewhere between New York and London  hence the delayed upload...) Thanks Rob + Josh (and Michael) BIG NEWS.... we're writing a book! ⭐ All the stories we can’t tell on the podcast – in depth.⭐ What it’s like to raise a stiff neck and a loose neck – straight from the horse’s mouth (our parents)⭐ And.. the BIGGEST REQUEST WE’VE EVER HAD FOR THE PODCAST… Hearing from our wives, Rose &amp; Lou. They’ve got a chapter each and YOU can submit your burning questions to them...     PARENTINGHELLBOOK@BONNIERBOOKS.CO.UKWhat's it really like to be a parent? And how come no one ever warned Rob or Josh of the sheer mind-bending, world-altering, sleep-depriving, sick-covering, tear-inducing, snot-wiping, bore-inspiring, 4am-relationship-straining brutality of it all? And if they did, why can't they remember it (or remember anything else, for that matter)?And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.Find out everything you need to know, including how you could win a pair of tickets to the Parenting Hell LIVE tour &amp; an overnight stay in London here: https://www.bit.ly/ParentingHellBookIf you want to get in touch with the show here's how:EMAIL: Hello@lockdownparenting.co.ukTWITTER: @parenting_hellINSTAGRAM: @parentinghellMAILING LIST: parentinghellpodcast.mailchimpsites.com A 'Keep It Light Media' Production Sales, advertising, and general enquiries:  hello@keepitlightmedia.com

      <description>S04 EP40: Katherine Ryan (The Return) Joining us this episode to discuss the highs and lows of parenting (and life) it's the return of our first ever guest on Parenting Hell, the brilliant comedian, Katherine Ryan. Katherine's new TV series 'Backstage with Katherine Ryan' is available to watch now on Amazon Prime. Thanks, Rob + Josh.BIG NEWS.... we're writing a book! ⭐ All the stories we can’t tell on the podcast – in depth.⭐ What it’s like to raise a stiff neck and a loose neck – straight from the horse’s mouth (our parents)⭐ And.. the BIGGEST REQUEST WE’VE EVER HAD FOR THE PODCAST… Hearing from our wives, Rose &amp; Lou. They’ve got a chapter each and YOU can submit your burning questions to them...     PARENTINGHELLBOOK@BONNIERBOOKS.CO.UKWhat's it really like to be a parent? And how come no one ever warned Rob or Josh of the sheer mind-bending, world-altering, sleep-depriving, sick-covering, tear-inducing, snot-wiping, bore-inspiring, 4am-relationship-straining brutality of it all? And if they did, why can't they remember it (or remember anything else, for that matter)?And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.Find out everything you need to know, including how you could win a pair of tickets to the Parenting Hell LIVE tour &amp; an overnight stay in London here: https://www.bit.ly/ParentingHellBookWe're going on tour!!

      <description>S04 EP27: The One Where Josh Google's himself...

More (mis) adventures in parenting and beyond from Rob and Josh...

Enjoy. Rate and Review.


BIG NEWS.... we're writing a book!

⭐ All the stories we can’t tell on the podcast – in depth.

⭐ What it’s like to raise a stiff neck and a loose neck – straight from the horse’s mouth (our parents)

⭐ And.. the BIGGEST REQUEST WE’VE EVER HAD FOR THE PODCAST… Hearing from our wives, Rose &amp; Lou. They’ve got a chapter each and YOU can submit your burning questions to them... PARENTINGHELLBOOK@BONNIERBOOKS.CO.UK

What's it really like to be a parent? And how come no one ever warned Rob or Josh of the sheer mind-bending, world-altering, sleep-depriving, sick-covering, tear-inducing, snot-wiping, bore-inspiring, 4am-relationship-straining brutality of it all? And if they did, why can't they remember it (or remember anything else, for that matter)?

And just when they thought it couldn't get any harder, why didn't anyone warn them about the slices of unmatched euphoric joy and pride that occasionally come piercing through, drenching you in unbridled happiness in much the same way a badly burped baby drenches you in milk-sick?

Join Josh and Rob as they share the challenges and madness of their parenting journeys with lashings of empathy and extra helpings of laughs. Filled with all the things they never tell you at antenatal classes, Parenting Hell is a beguiling mixture of humour, rumination and conversation for prospective parents, new parents, old parents and never-to-be parents alike.

      <link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/12633137/parenting-hell-michael-mcintyre-f</link>
      <description>S03 EP28: Michael McIntyre

Joining us this episode to discuss the highs and lows of parenting (and life) is the brilliant comedian and presenter, Michael McIntyre. 

Michael's fantastic new book 'A Funny Life' is available now: http://smarturl.it/AFunnyLife

In A Funny Life, Michael honestly and hilariously shares the highs and the lows of his rise to the top and desperate attempts to stay there. It’s all here, from his disastrous panel show appearances to his hit TV shows, from mistakenly thinking he’d be a good chat show host and talent judge, to finding fame and fortune beyond his wildest dreams and becoming the biggest-selling comedian in the world. Along the way he opens his man drawer, narrowly avoids disaster when his trousers fall down in front of three policemen and learns the hard way why he should always listen to his wife.

Please rate and review. 
Thanks - Rob and Josh

      <description>ROB BECKETT &amp; JOSH WIDDICOMBE'S 'LOCKDOWN PARENTING HELL' S02 EP7: Paloma Faith Joining us in the studio this episode to discuss the highs and lows of parenting (and life) during the lockdown and beyond is the brilliant singer and actress, Paloma Faith.Enjoy. Rate and Review. Thanks. xxx Paloma's new album 'Infinite Things' is available now and her new documentary is on the BBC on the 27th March:Paloma Faith has sold well over a million albums, had number ones all over the world, headlined Glastonbury, and sung to tens of thousands every week, but now, she is taking on her toughest challenge yet - having a baby. With unlimited access to Paloma as a woman, a mother, and an international pop-star in the public eye, this film follows Paloma on an emotional journey, as she balances the demands of a vital make-or-break tour with writing a new album, launching an acting career, and being a first-time mum. Filmed throughout 2019, the film observes Paloma’s life, both front and backstage, in the midst of a pivotal year in her career. It features appearances and contributions from Rag’n’Bone Man, Ty Taylor, and Jonas Blue as well as her band, management, and family members. We see her struggling with choices every mum will be familiar with, whilst embarking on enormous career challenges in a cut-throat business. Paloma not only returns to work after having her baby but also to huge expectations to break Australia and America. At every turn, we ask ‘Will Paloma pull it off?’ and although she ultimately looks successful, she is tested to the limit in doing so.If you want to get in touch with the show here's how:EMAIL: Hello@lockdownparenting.co.ukTWITTER: @lockdownparent INSTAGRAM: @lockdown_parentingA 'Keep It Light Media' Production Sales, advertising, and general enquiries:  hello@keepitlightmedia.com
