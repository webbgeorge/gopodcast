      <title>CHER LLOYD EXCLUSIVE: THE TRUTH ABOUT X FACTOR WITH ONE DIRECTION! I REFUSED TO BE NOTHING.</title>
      <description>"I Proved Them All Wrong - One Direction Were Like Family"

Join us for an inspiring episode as Cher Lloyd delves deep into her journey from a breakout star on X-Factor to overcoming the challenges of media scrutiny and personal transformation. 
At just 16, Cher quickly rose to fame, finishing fourth on the show and charting hits in both the US and UK. Yet, behind the scenes, she faced intense media torment that shaped her public image into something she didn’t recognise. 
In this heartfelt interview, Cher reveals the true self behind the 'villain' persona once painted by the press, sharing insights into the real-life impacts of fame and the media's role in it.

Cher also opens up about her personal growth through motherhood and how it shifted her career trajectory, discussing the industry's cold shoulder during her pregnancy and her decade-long partnership with her husband, Craig. 
After a significant break from music, Cher is back, ready to reclaim her space in the music industry with newfound resilience and empowerment. 
Tune in to hear how Cher Lloyd transforms adversities into a powerful narrative of self-acceptance and determination, proving that stepping back can be a pathway to leaping forward.

      <title>Leading Psychiatrist: Is High Functioning Depression Harming Your Love Life? - Dr Judith Joseph</title>
      <description>In this episode, we sit down with Dr. Judith Joseph, a leading psychiatrist and mental health expert, to explore high-functioning depression and anhedonia—two often-overlooked mental health conditions that can profoundly affect both personal well-being and relationships.

Dr. Judith shares her insights on how people may appear to have everything under control while silently struggling, and she provides practical advice for identifying these hidden signs and managing them effectively.

      <title>The Gottmans: “Contempt DESTROYS Your Immune System” - Are You REALLY Listening to Your Partner??</title>
      <description>In this episode, Dr. John and Dr. Julie Gottman, world-renowned relationship experts and founders of The Gottman Institute, share their research-based insights into what truly makes relationships work. With over 50 years of research on marital stability and parenting, they dive deep into key issues like how contempt can destroy your immune system, and why certain toxic behaviors—like criticism and stonewalling—are major red flags in relationships.
They also debunk common myths such as "Never go to bed angry" and explain how empathy and emotional intelligence are critical to lasting love.

The Gottmans provide practical advice on how to manage conflict, heal from childhood trauma, and create deeper emotional connections. Whether you're navigating daily disagreements or looking to rebuild trust after betrayal, this conversation is filled with valuable takeaways to help you strengthen your relationship and build a healthier, more fulfilling partnership.

      <title>Relationship Expert: “Onlyfans Is DESTROYING Modern Dating!”, Why He Is Cheating! And “Trying Open Relationships, Means You CANT Trust Again”?! - Sadia Khan</title>
      <description>We Need To Talk: In this thought-provoking episode, relationship expert and coach Sadia Khan openly shares her own perspectives on modern dating, masculinity, and the evolving nature of intimate relationships.

Paul and Sadia dive deep into the impact of the sexual revolution, which Sadia believes has led to a decline in masculinity among men and an enhancement of masculinity in women. 
They also examine how adult media platforms like Only Fans are eroding intimacy, while fuelling infidelity in modern relationships.

Sadia shares her beliefs on the importance of being a 'high-value man’ and offers her perspective on whether non-monogamous relationships can truly work within the structures of marriage.

By the end of this conversation, listeners can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the struggles in modern dating, the challenges young men face, and the reasons why many modern relationships are failing, all while exploring the conflict between traditional values and today’s evolving dating culture.

      <title>Lauren Goodger: "I'm Finally Ready To Tell The Truth!" My Untold Story Of Heartbreak, Relationships &amp; Loss</title>
      <description>We Need To Talk: In this episode, we uncover the untold truth behind TV superstar Lauren Goodger. Lauren, a TV icon, entrepreneur, and mother, rose to fame on The Only Way is Essex (TOWIE) from 2010 to 2012 and made a much-anticipated return in 2024.
