I'm your host, Mick Hunt, and today we have an incredible story of resilience, leadership, and personal growth with our special guest, Diamyn Hall. Once a star athlete with dreams of the NFL, Diamyn faced a life-altering injury at age 14 that changed his trajectory. In this episode, he shares how he transitioned from football to baseball, eventually building a cutting-edge mental skills and leadership system that led teams to championships and got players drafted.<br></p> <p>Diamyn's journey is a testament to the power of the "one-day contract mentality" and the importance of hyper-individualization in training. He delves into his return to on-site coaching at IMG Academy, mentorship under Dave Turgeon, and his current role with the Orioles where he works on a "blank canvas" to further his developmental goals. We'll also discuss pivotal moments and influential books that shaped his career and his transformative advice for young athletes.<br></p> <p>Mick Hunt emphasizes how these lessons extend beyond sports, advocating for everyday excellence in all walks of life. Stay tuned as Diamyn Hall shares exclusive insights and announces an upcoming masterclass on mindset, leadership, and personal growth.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone, welcome back to another episode of "Mick Unplugged." I&rsquo;m your host, Mick Hunt. Today we have a super exciting guest joining us&mdash;Kim Roberts. For those of you who may not know, Kim has an incredible background rooted deeply in her Caribbean culture, which has shaped her journey in ways she&rsquo;ll share with us today. From her university days, where she helped form strong communities, to her breakout role on the beloved show "Schitt's Creek," Kim's story is as inspiring as it is unique.<br></p> <p>We'll dive into her favorite roles, including her current passion project at the Stratford Festival, and get into the nitty-gritty of voice acting versus theatrical performance. Kim will also reflect on her experiences facing racial isolation growing up in Canada, and how she found her way into the world of acting, despite early aspirations to become a doctor or lawyer. Stick around as Kim talks about her personal interests, like cooking her favorite curry chicken, and her current and upcoming projects, including a special film debuting soon on Paramount Plus.<br></p> <p>To top it all off, we'll hear a heartwarming Thanksgiving anecdote and Kim's gratitude for the audience&rsquo;s continuous support. And there might even be some light-hearted banter about her character&rsquo;s pet Chick Aletta from "Paw Patrol." So, get ready to be inspired by Kim's perseverance and dedication to her craft, and maybe even pick up some tips on finding success and purpose. Let's jump right in!<strong><br></strong></p> <p><strong><br>Takeaways:<br></strong></p> <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acting is like breathing; it's essential to me.</p> <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mentorship is about sharing wisdom and opening doors.</p> <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural identity shapes our experiences and perspectives.</p> <p><strong>Sound Bites:</strong></p> <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Voice acting allows for creative freedom without physical constraints.&rdquo;</p> <p>&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Emphasizes authenticity by connecting personal experiences with her characters.&rdquo;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong><br>Connect and Discover<br><br></strong></p> <p><strong>LinkedIn:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linkedin.com/in/kim-roberts-4586508a</strong></p> <p><strong>Instagram:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instagram.com/mskimroberts</strong></p> <p><strong>Facebook:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; facebook.com/kimmyonline</strong></p> <p><strong>Threads: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @mskimroberts</strong></p> <p><strong>X:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; kimroberts1</strong></p> <p><strong>Film:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All The Lost Ones</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to another exciting episode of "Mick Unplugged." I'm your host, Mick Hunt, and today, we have a true sports legend joining us‚Äînone other than Rick Barry. In this episode, we dive deep into Rick's storied basketball career and his transition to success in pickleball, where he's clinched numerous national championships. We explore his unique take on game fundamentals, including his famous underhand free throw technique, and his candid critique of modern NBA play. Rick shares nostalgic tales, like his missed 1964 Olympic opportunity, and opens up about his joy and pride in his sons' basketball careers, with special mention of Canyon Barry's impact on the 3x3 basketball scene.<br></p> <p>We also venture beyond the court as Rick discusses his new passion for pickleball, his entrepreneurial ventures like founding Pickle Zone, and his dedication to promoting health and wellness products. Plus, get insights into his lifelong love for fly fishing, his upcoming engagements in Australia and New Zealand, and his wishes for unity and progress in our country.<br></p> <p>It's a conversation filled with wisdom, nostalgia, and inspiration. So, stay tuned as we unplug with the one and only Rick Barry!<strong><br><br>Takeaways:</strong></p> <p>¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† NBA teams should consider underhand free throw technique.</p> <p>¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Competing in pickleball and winning national championships</p> <p>¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Disappointment over not making the 1964 Olympic team</p> <p><br><strong>Questions &amp; Answers:</strong><br><br></p> <p>1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Question:<br><strong>Mick Hunt:</strong> Rick, you've been a vocal advocate for the underhand free-throw technique. Why do you think it's not more widely adopted in today's NBA, even though it has a proven high success rate?</p> <p><strong>Rick Barry</strong><strong>:</strong> Mick, it boils down to ego and aesthetics. Players don't want to be seen as 'unconventional' or 'old-fashioned.' Despite its effectiveness, the underhand technique has a stigma. My success rate with it was over 92%, which proves its value. It's a missed opportunity for many players today.<br></p> <p>2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Question:</p> <p><strong>Mick Hunt:</strong>¬†You've mentioned that modern NBA players often lack deep understanding of game fundamentals. What specific fundamentals do you see as being most neglected?</p> <p><strong>Rick Barry</strong><strong>:</strong> players today often overlook positioning, screening, and teamwork dynamics. Natural talent is great, but without mastering these basics, it‚Äôs hard to reach full potential. A strong foundation in fundamentals is crucial for long-term success in the game.<br></p> <p>3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Question:</p> <p><strong>Mick Hunt:</strong>¬†Let's talk about officiating. You've criticized the leniency towards moving screens and carrying violations today. How do you think stricter officiating could impact the game?</p> <p><strong>Rick Barry</strong><strong>:</strong> Better officiating would enforce proper gameplay, improving the quality and fairness of basketball.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to Mick Unplugged! In today's episode, we dive into an eye-opening discussion with Dr. Anthony Mazzella, a trailblazer in integrated medicine and holistic care. Together with your host Mick Hunt, Dr. Mazzella challenges conventional wisdom on boundaries in relationships, offering insights into the value of getting closer to someone's subjective experience for true understanding and conflict resolution.</p> <p>We delve deep into psychodynamic and psychoanalytic therapies, exploring how they address root causes rather than just symptoms. Dr. Mazzella sheds light on complex topics like narcissism and borderline personality disorder, emphasizing the importance of self-reflection and effective communication.

      <itunes:title>Unleashing Your Superpower: Transforming 'Because' into Action ‚Äì Mick Unplugged [Ep 2]</itunes:title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Mick begins with a personal anecdote, drawing us into the world of self-discovery. He speaks of a time when he realized that identifying one's 'because' is not merely about goal-setting but igniting a deep-seated passion and purpose within. He shares his experiences of introspection, the challenges of evaluating his social circle, and the power of solitude and journaling in uncovering his true mission.</p><p>As the story progresses, Mick highlights the significance of celebrating small victories. He narrates tales of individuals who transformed their lives by acknowledging every minor success, emphasizing that each small win is a crucial brushstroke in the larger canvas of life.</p><p>The narrative turns towards daily living, where Mick illustrates how embedding one's core purpose into every aspect of life can lead to profound changes. He shares practical examples of using one's 'because' as a filter for decision-making and the importance of nightly reflections to stay aligned with long-term aspirations.</p><p>Mick then guides us through tracking progress and reflecting on the journey. Through vivid storytelling, he depicts how documenting every step, whether through a journal or an app, helps recognize the transformation within and learn from both victories and setbacks.</p><p>The climax of the episode is about adaptability and resilience. Mick shares stories of individuals who embraced change, pivoted strategies, and learned from every situation, highlighting the importance of a growth mindset and flexibility in pursuing one's 'because'.</p><p><strong>Key Points to Remember:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Discover Your 'Because':</strong> Go beyond goals to find your true passion and purpose.</li><li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Acknowledge every small achievement as a step towards your larger goal.</li><li><strong>Live Your Purpose Daily:</strong> Integrate your core purpose into every decision and action.</li><li><strong>Track and Reflect:</strong> Document your journey and learn from successes and failures.</li><li><strong>Be Adaptable:</strong> Embrace change and maintain a growth mindset to navigate life's challenges.</li></ol><p>As the episode draws to a close, Mick leaves us with a powerful message: our 'because' is our superpower, and by unleashing it, we can transform our lives and impact the world around us. He encourages listeners to step out not just as dreamers but as doers, architects of their own future, and champions of their own story.</p><p>Stay tuned for more empowering stories and insights on Mick Unplugged, where every episode is a step towards unlocking your true potential.</p> <strong> <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mickunplugged" rel="payment" title="‚òÖ Support this podcast on Patreon ‚òÖ">‚òÖ Support this podcast on Patreon ‚òÖ</a> </strong><p>See <a href="https://omnystudio.com/listener">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Once upon a time, in the realm of podcasts, there emerged a show that sought to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. This show was "Mick Unplugged," hosted by the charismatic Mick Hunt.

He proposed a deeper exploration into the essence of 'Because,' which he described as the driving force that turns dreams into reality. This concept was not just about understanding one's motivations but about activating them into tangible actions.</p><p>Throughout the episode, Mick engaged his audience ‚Äì the dreamers, the leaders, and those yearning to leave their mark on the world. He discussed how 'Because' is more than a motivator; it's the relentless energy that propels one towards their goals. He emphasized that while 'Why' can point to the peak of the mountain, 'Because' is the force that drives one to climb it.</p><p>Mick shared personal stories and real-life examples to illustrate the power of 'Because.' He spoke of Sarah, a young entrepreneur whose 'Because' transformed her from a dreamer into a doer, leading her to create a multimillion-dollar business. He talked about Alex, a sales professional whose 'Because' was to build a future for his kids, driving him to become the top salesperson in his company. Mick also opened up about his journey, revealing how a promise made to his mother at a young age became his 'Because,' shaping his life and career.</p><p><br><strong>As the episode neared its end, Mick offered practical steps for his listeners to embrace their 'Because':</strong></p><ul><li>Reflect on past victories and struggles to identify your 'Because.'</li><li>Make 'Because' a visible and daily habit.</li><li>Seek opportunities that resonate with your 'Because' for a fulfilling life.</li><li>Share your 'Because' for accountability and inspiration.</li></ul><p>Mick concluded the episode with empowering words, urging his audience to embrace and unleash their 'Because.'
