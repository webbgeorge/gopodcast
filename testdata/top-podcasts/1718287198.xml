      <title>The BrewDog Famechaser</title>
      <description>James Watt: BrewDog 'Co-founder' and now self-described 'Co-Captain', investor and... TV personality? He wants you to know that he has a new show that sounds a lot like Dragons Den but isn't Dragons Den... House of Unicorns. 

Is it any different? Why does James feel the need to be a TV star? Will he be successful?

It's the story that keeps having new chapters. Marina brings us the latest developments in Blake Lively vs. Justin Baldoni. 

And The Traitors wrapped up with the show's biggest ever audience. What did Richard and Marina make of the final and can it keep on growing without the contestants becoming too savvy about how it works.

      <title>The Rock’s Beef With Vin Diesel</title>
      <description>Are The Rock and Vin Diesel furious with one another or fast friends? With an on-again off-again beef brewing since 2016, Richard &amp; Marina bring us up to speed on the latest in the action men saga after both showed some love for the other at the 2025 Golden Globes.

The LA fires have dominated the news cycles since they broke out with many famous names, as well as those behind scenes, impacted. With fewer films being made in Hollywood each year, will it fully recover from this latest blow?

Better Man, the Robbie Williams biopic where he is portrayed as a CGI monkey has bombed at the box office. With a hefty budget, where did the backing come from?

As mentioned in the show - 

The Rock &amp; Vin Diesel and the oddly angled shot here

Will Tavlin’s Casual Viewing blog post here

Recommendations:

Marina - Beast Games (Prime Video)
Richard - Patrick Radden Keefe - Say Nothing (read)

      <title>Has Strictly Saved Itself?</title>
      <description>With Chris McCausland winning Strictly Come Dancing and the Xmas special being especially feel-good, has Strictly saved itself as the raft of upheld complaints and accusations that preceded the most recent series?

Richard lets us know if it’s possible to appear on several quiz shows and what producers are looking for in contestants.

Plus, was 2024 ‘the rise of celebrity surgery’ and will certain trends carry on into 2025?

      <title>Blake Lively Bombshell &amp; Beast Games</title>
      <description>What happens inside a Hollywood smear machine? This week Blake Lively filed a legal complaint which revealed private messages detailing an alleged campaign to tarnish her, after she accused director and co-star Justin Baldoni of misconduct on the set of “It Ends With Us.”

Where does this leave both parties and what does it tell us about the dark arts in Hollywood PR?

MrBeast aka Jimmy Donaldson released the much anticipated Beast Games on Amazon. Known for his big budget YouTube gameshows, Amazon gave him a reported $100 million to create a gameshow. Is it good? Does he manage to transfer from YouTube to streaming? What does it tell us about not just entertainment, but the world in which we find ourselves?

And lastly, some festive cheer. Richard and Marina look back on how linear TV bagged huge audiences as we all came together for Xmas viewing. Will Gavin and Stacey roll back the clock and deliver a multi-million audience?

Recommendations:

Marina - Inside No 9: The Party's Over (iPlayer)
Richard - Black Doves (Netflix)

      <itunes:summary>What happens inside a Hollywood smear machine? This week Blake Lively filed a legal complaint which revealed private messages detailing an alleged campaign to tarnish her, after she accused director and co-star Justin Baldoni of misconduct on the set of “It Ends With Us.”

Where does this leave both parties and what does it tell us about the dark arts in Hollywood PR?

MrBeast aka Jimmy Donaldson released the much anticipated Beast Games on Amazon. Known for his big budget YouTube gameshows, Amazon gave him a reported $100 million to create a gameshow. Is it good? Does he manage to transfer from YouTube to streaming? What does it tell us about not just entertainment, but the world in which we find ourselves?

And lastly, some festive cheer. Richard and Marina look back on how linear TV bagged huge audiences as we all came together for Xmas viewing. Will Gavin and Stacey roll back the clock and deliver a multi-million audience?

Recommendations:

Marina - Inside No 9: The Party's Over (iPlayer)
Richard - Black Doves (Netflix)

      <title>Lisa Nandy, Tech Bros &amp; The Sephora Crisis</title>
      <description>As the government debates a new bill covering how AI has to abide by copyright laws, is it better for creative industries to keep their friends close but enemies closer?

Sephora, Drunk Elephant, Sol de Janeiro are at the front of what some have called an epidemic amongst 'tweens' (pre-teens). These beauty and skincare brands are often pushed by influencers but what does it tell us about modern advertising and commercialism.

Finally Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has upset the TV industry after attacking a lack of creativity and diversity. Do her points have merit or is it misplaced and is she simply looking to score some easy points?

      <title>How To Create Movie Sex Sounds</title>
      <description>What are the unassuming every day items that foley artists, those who create sound fx, use to create iconic moments of sound?

Spotify Wrapped has become a cultural moment, how does it work?

Eating scenes on screen. Do actors really eat a load of food and how do they deliver their lines clearly with their mouths full?

Another peeks behind the curtain with Richard Osman and Marina Hyde on this Q&amp;A episode of The Rest Is Entertainment.

      <title>Leave Ariana Grande Alone</title>
      <description>Many of the reports around Wicked haven’t focused on the quality of the film, but once again on the appearance of one of its stars, Ariana Grande. Is the reporting on female appearance becoming more toxic than ever before?

Will a TikTok Grandma win the battle for Christmas number 1? Richard takes us through the historical runners and riders.

Our friends at More In Common carried out some polling based upon some previous show topics as promised. Does the UK think Jeremy Clarkson could be PM? What is Britain’s most loved Christmas song? And, most importantly which is the nation’s favourite Quality Street… Richard and Marina disagree.

      <title>Gregg Wallace. A Recipe For Disaster</title>
      <description>With the accusations surrounding MasterChef's Gregg Wallace, Richard &amp; Marina look at the accusations and what’s behind the headlines. 

Moana 2 looks set to be a huge hit for Pixar, but what can fans expect from the sequel?

Two very different TV documentaries are on the way. Game of Throws, explores the world of darts and the colourful characters within the sport, whilst in Meet the Rees-Moggs we go inside the home of former-Conservative MP Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg. Are they the new Kardashians?

      <title>Richard’s Superpower &amp; Marina’s Warren Beatty Meeting</title>
      <description>What happened when Marina met Warren Beatty, and what are the secrets of press junkets? Is it important you know your conjecture verb from your adjunctive noun? Is there really an order to “in no particular order?”

Those questions and more in the one hundredth episode of The Rest Is Entertainment with Richard Osman and Marina Hyde.

      <title>Jeremy Clarkson For Prime Minister?</title>
      <description>With Trump's election in the US, could we in the UK see a celebrity Prime Minister? And is Jeremy Clarkson that man? Who might the other contenders be if it were to happen?

The iconic Jaguar car company has had a rebrand and it has been less than well received. What are the secrets to a successful rebrand?

And finally on this episode we celebrate a format that is bucking the trend of declining audiences on linear TV, the quiz show. With their success only getting bigger, will they outgrow their traditional home?

      <title>Bookshelves - The Nation Speaks</title>
      <description>The inbox was aflame after last week's Q&amp;A episode where Marina declared Richard a "psychopath" for the way he arranged his books. Today we'll get into your take on the matter. Who is right and who is wrong? And, how do you arrange yours?

Did Rob Beckett really buy a Blankety Blank contestant a TV from his own pocket? Rob himself gives us the story. What winds journalists up most when they see a newspaper on-screen? Are nightclubs going to die? 

You can send your questions to Marina and Richard at therestisentertainment@gmail.com

      <title>Mike Tyson, Bluesky &amp; Christmas Adverts</title>
      <description>It was the event *few* were talking about yet they were talking loudly. Jake Paul took on Mike Tyson live on Netflix. Who were the big winners and losers of the night?

The Guardian and others have said they'll no longer post on Twitter / X and more are moving over to Bluesky. Is this a false dawn of a peaceful online place of hope that can no longer realistically exist?

And, we need to mention the C-word again. The big retailers have rolled out their Christmas adverts. Which are good? Which are bad? Do they make any difference to where you choose to spend your all important Christmas pound?

      <title>How The Media Won It For Trump</title>
      <description>Did legacy media lose it for Harris, and new media win it for Trump? Marina and Richard take us through how both campaigns used the media as tools to put their messages across and support their campaigns.

One of the TV events of the year is upon us as 12 celebrities head into the jungle for I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. With the lineup in place we go through the runners and riders of this year's camp mates.

Another event in the calendar is the release of the annual Now! compilation album. Richard gives us a history of its release, its heyday, and how it fits into the future of music.

Recommendations:

Richard: The Diplomat (Netflix)

One of the TV events of the year is upon us as 12 celebrities head into the jungle for I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. With the lineup in place we go through the runners and riders of this year's camp mates.

Another event in the calendar is the release of the annual Now! compilation album. Richard gives us a history of its release, its heyday, and how it fits into the future of music.

Recommendations:

Richard: The Diplomat (Netflix)

      <title>Are Newsroom Backgrounds Real Or Fake?</title>
      <description>Are those people working, or eating their lunch, in the background of newsrooms live, or is it all faked? What is the thought process behind adaptations and who decides if it is best to adapt for film or TV? When reporters are in a war zone, do they have access to water, food, power? And how safe are they?

Richard Osman and Marina Hyde answer your questions.

      <title>TV Is Dead, But Michael Parkinson Is Alive</title>
      <description>National treasure Michael Parkinson has a new podcast, but how will a man who died in 2023, be brought to life for it? Richard has the inside track on the AI used, the ethical considerations, and the sensitivities that have gone into the project.

If it has escaped your attention, there will be a new leader of the free world this week as America takes to the polls. Marina gives us the history of how entertainment has shaped the US election coverage.

Lastly as linear TV continues to decline, some new data has emerged as to what we are consuming in its place and how it's changing what we expect from our entertainment. 

Recommendations:

Richard: Showtrail (iPlayer)

      <title>The Death Of Click-Bait</title>
      <description>It's Halloween so Richard and Marina explore horror and why it is the most bankable genre at the box office and is continuing to thrive. 

Reach is a huge media company you might not be familiar with, but you will see their content as they own over 240 local media titles. With that comes the need for a lot of content. Does their reach mean even worse news for local journalism?

Finally we need to mention the C-word... Christmas. Hallmark has announced a raft of new Christmas movies including a tie in with The Kansas City Chiefs.... aka the NFL team Taylor Swift's boyfriend plays for. Richard and Marina explain why this is another example of companies being clever with their content, and why Hallmark are so good at Christmas.

As Director General Tim Davie tackles the term 'talent' at the BBC, what does it really mean and how important are the 'talent'?

      <title>The Biggest Flop Of All Time?</title>
      <description>Potentially the biggest flop of all time isn't from Hollywood, in publishing, or on the small screen. Richard &amp; Marina discuss the failing of Sony's Concord, an online shooter game taken offline just two weeks after release.

From huge flop to huge success, The Chosen is perhaps the most popular TV show in the world you've never heard of. How has this American Christian drama telling the story of Jesus of Nazareth, risen to achieve a Rotten Tomatoes rating on parity with Breaking Bad, The Wire and others?

On Rotten Tomatoes people are making (and losing) money betting on film popularity ratings. Is review bombing gaming this system?

And, what are the motivations for The Chasers and other quizzers? Isn't it a bit mean to potentially deprive people or charities of money?

      <title>Is The Bear REALLY a Comedy?</title>
      <description>If you've ever watched The Bear then you'll have seen anxiety inducing moments of real restaurant culture, tense family shouting matches and a ton more drama... however at the likes of the Emmys awards and the Golden Globes it is considered a comedy. Why?

The West End is in rude financial health with musicals and plays proving as popular as they ever were, returning to pre-Covid success. A lot of the big West End successes are based on films or existing stories. Is there a lack of creativity in theatre, and will it hurt the art in the long term?

Richard &amp; Marina wrap this episode by talking The White Stripes vs. Donald Trump. Jack White is suing the former American President for unauthorised use of a song, but he's not the first to take issue with their music being coopted by politicians.

      <title>Inside The Oasis Reunion</title>
      <description>If you missed it, Oasis are back. Noel and Liam Gallagher appear to have buried the hatchet and reformed one the UK's seminal bands for a tour in 2025. Tickets for said tour sold-out but note without controversy. Richard and Marina discuss the ticketing situation and the possible reasons for the Gallagher brothers to get the band back together.

'Wolfs' starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt seems to be another flop from Apple. Why are one of the world's biggest companies still making movies?

Finally this week we get into toxic fandom. Singer / songwriter Chappell Roan released a statement expressing her discomfort at the level of attention some fans believe they are entitled to. This has caused a bigger conversation within not only her own fans, but in the wider entertainment world about the access fans have, or expect.

'Wolfs' starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt seems to be another flop from Apple. Why are one of the world's biggest companies still making movies?

Finally this week we get into toxic fandom. Singer / songwriter Chappell Roan released a statement expressing her discomfort at the level of attention some fans believe they are entitled to. This has caused a bigger conversation within not only her own fans, but in the wider entertainment world about the access fans have, or expect.

      <title>Pitching Buckaroo To Spielberg</title>
      <description>Did Richard pitch 'Buckaroo The Movie' to Steven Spielberg?

How important are the timings of ad-breaks and features on radio to the routine of our lives? What is the history of 'cold opens'  in TV and what purpose do they serve? Has James Bond always loved a brand endorsement? 

Just a few of the questions posed by you and answered by Marina Hyde and Richard Osman on this, The Rest Is Entertainment.

      <title>The Crazy Rise &amp; Fall Of Cameo</title>
      <description>Cameo was a runaway business success during the world's lockdown but it has cut staff and is struggling to even pay small fines. What has happened to the celebrity video service? 

Have you heard of Fast TV? Richard and Marina take us through the new channels competing with some of the biggest names in streaming. 

Finally on this episode we turn to video gaming, Black Myth: Wukong has flown in at the top of the charts. It is a first AAA game from a Chinese developer but it has come with some controversy and also tells us a bigger story of entertainment within China and how Hollywood is courting Chinese audiences.

      <title>Matthew Perry &amp; The Dark Hollywood Underbelly</title>
      <description>Hollywood is a dream for many but a nightmare for others. Once you experience the highs of fame and fortune what comes next? How do you avoid being surrounded by those that don't have your best interests at heart? Matthew Perry's story can tell us a lot about how Hollywood corrupts.

Gen-Z royalty, Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury, announced their separation this week. Their relationship, use of social media, and the way they're written about tells us a lot about modern celebrity.

Richard has noticed some rather odd headlines from The Daily Telegraph. He asks why they're framing stories in the way they are, who might benefit and he and Marina discuss who might be in pole position to how the Telegraph titles.

      <title>Who is Banksy?</title>
      <description>Banksy has been more active than ever this past week, but how has he kept his identity hidden for so long? Do Richard and Marina use their own signatures when giving autographs? Why has the UK regained its status as a premier movie shooting location and what promoted it to change?

      <title>Should You Leave Twitter?</title>
      <description>Elon Musk is suing advertisers over an X / Twitter 'boycott' which in addition to content and his own posts, is for many a bridge too far. Will courts find in his favour and will a drop off in users hurt the company overall? 

Katy Perry's comeback appears to have fallen flat, so what can be learned and how do you make a successful comeback? 

Lastly, Mr Beast. Shooting of the world's biggest gameshow which he's producing for Amazon is underway but it hasn't gone smoothly so far.

      <title>Robert Downey Jr &amp; the Death of TV Comedy</title>
      <description>Marvel superfans were shocked at the reveal that the next villain to star in the Avengers series would be played by none other than Robert Downey Jr.

Will this gamble resurrect the MCU, or is this just another confusing addition to their multiverse of madness?

Richard and Marina also chat about the impact of TikTok on stand up at Edinburgh Fringe Festival and how it has helped cause the death of comedy on television.

      <title>Taylor Swift On House of Games?</title>
      <description>Is there ever a celebrity booking that is TOO big? Well Richard and Marina imagine a scenario where Taylor Swift is on House of Games and what impact it might have on the usual production processes.

"In a world..." where trailer's don't have that deep American voice Marina explains why they fell out of fashion.

And, do football commentators get paid more if a match goes to extra time and then penalties.

      <title>Brat Summer &amp; THAT Olympic Ceremony</title>
      <description>Thanks to Charli XCX's latest album 'Brat', this is brat summer. What is brat summer, and what is it with the slime green colour we're seeing across the internet and in the real world? 

Richard and Marina takes us inside the Olympic opening ceremony, revealing how it came together and what it takes to produce such a spectacle. 

And it seems it Hollywood is in a cycle of reboots. Marina &amp; Richard look at the possible causes, effects, and what it says about audiences.

      <title>Which Dumped Tory Will Do 'Strictly'?</title>
      <description>In an act of disastrous political timing, Jill Biden has appeared on the front cover of US Vogue. Does this tin-eared response to her husband’s catastrophic debate performance spell the end to Hollywood’s elite support for the Democrats.

And finally, as Thursday’s General Election brought forth a Tory Wipeout - Richard tells us which former MPs would be best at a Bushtucker Trial.

      <title>What Can TV Learn From Podcasts?</title>
      <description>The double bounce of an election and the Euros has led to some very successful podcasts achieving even bigger numbers. Many of these podcast hosts are also part of the TV coverage, so how does one format bleed into the other, what can TV learn from podcasts, and should podcasts really be on TV?

'The Apprentice' (a biographical drama of Donald Trump in the 70s &amp; 80s and 'The Last Screenwriter' (a film written by AI) are struggling to find distributors. What are the reasons for this, and what does it say about the wider movie industry?

Lastly, House of Games filmed its Christmas episodes but what how do you create that festive atmosphere in the Summer?

      <itunes:summary>Football will dominate our TV screens for the next few weeks, but how are the games chosen between the BBC and ITV, and how important is England's success for ITV's profits?

What is the history behind some of your favourite TV theme tunes (which you can enjoy in a handy playlist here)? And Dad TV. Richard and Marina breakdown a much watched, but perhaps little written about genre, which has more familiar shows than you might guess.

      <title>Why Do Gigs Cost So Much?</title>
      <description>The American Department of Justice are seeking to break up Ticketmaster and Live Nation to try and make gigs cheaper. How did Ticketmaster gain such a grip on the music industry, and if the DOJ are successful what could it mean for live music in the UK?

Loaded magazine is back... Richard and Marina trace it's history and that of 'lad mags'. Is there a bloodline to today's toxic masculinity?

Finally, we have our hands on the second viewing data dump from Netflix and it has sparked a possible billion-dollar idea from Richard!

      <title>Auditions, Adaptations and Law Suits</title>
      <description>Do all actors have to audition and what is the modern audition process? How do you translate a book to a film or even a theatre production? Can it be a simple copy and paste? Plus how do shows such as Mr Bates vs. The Post Office avoid law suits from those that are shown in what could be described as, an unfavourable light?

Those questions and more tackled by Richard and Marina on The Rest Is Entertainment.

      <title>How to make a billion in showbiz</title>
      <description>The Sunday Times rich list has been revealed but which are the names from the world of entertainment, and how have they made their money?

Cannes Film Festival is underway, and the world has seen for the first time Francis Ford Coppola's Megalopolis. A film long talked about and self-financed by the man himself, why has he had to put his hand in his own pocket, like Kevin Coster with Horizon: An American Saga, is it all vanity?

Plus, Have I Got News For You is soon to be on US screens. Does the history of UK formats trying to make it in American show it will be a success?

The Fall Guy had an average box office opening weekend, does it reflect the current health of Hollywood and the star power of Ryan Gosling &amp; Emily Blunt? Lastly Doctor Who returned with Ncuti Gatwa as the new Doctor and the first taste of the BBC &amp; Disney co-production.... how will this impact the franchise in the future?

      <description>How do you make sure each contestant is treated equally on Mastermind?

      <title>The Oscars, Ozempic &amp; Wonka</title>
      <description>With the Oscars last night we bring you an earlier than billed episode as Richard and Marina reflect on Al Pacino's 'best picture' announcement fluff, the real cost of "what are you wearing?" and the Hollywood epidemic of Ozempic.

It's not all about the Oscars though, as Richard celebrates Channel 5's fast turnaround documentaries in light of a forthcoming Glasgow Willy Wonka tell-all. Plus, is boxing now a reality show after the announcement of Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson coming to Netflix.

First up for discussion, is Nigel Farage a good booking for I'm a Celebrity? And will a stint in the jungle help his PR?
Why did Jeff Bezos agree to an excruciating interview and photoshoot along with fiance Lauren Sánchez in American Vogue?
And Richard explains why he loves the new Netflix game show version of Squid Game, while Marina takes a rather different view.
