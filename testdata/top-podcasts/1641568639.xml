    <title>This is History: A Dynasty to Die For</title>
    <language>en</language>
    <copyright>Sony Music Entertainment</copyright>
    <description>Power, greed, religion and sex: historian Dan Jones brings the drama of mediaeval history to life through compelling stories, fascinating characters and vivid scenes.

“A Dynasty to Die For” tells the story of the Plantagenets, one of the most powerful and dysfunctional families in European history. Their scandals, betrayals and bloody politics shaped the world we live in today.

In Season 6 we meet King Edward III, the ambitious warrior responsible for starting the Hundred Years’ War. But while Edward is waging his campaigns overseas, a new threat to his kingdom is brewing. The Black Death is coming, and nothing will ever be the same again.

      <title>In Conversation | Mediaeval sex and bishop brothels  - with Diarmaid MacCulloch</title>
      <description>This episode contains frequent references to sex.



Dan Jones is joined by Professor Diarmaid MacCulloch, author of Lower than the Angels, for a look at the long and complicated relationship between the Church and our love lives. Who was Pope Gregory VII and why did he want to stop clergy from having sex? How have views on same-sex love changed over time? And why were bishops in charge of London’s first brothels?

      <title>In Conversation | The tyrant and the usurper - with Helen Castor</title>
      <description>Dan is joined by his friend and mentor, the renowned historian and author of The Eagle and The Hart, Dr Helen Castor, for a rundown of the wildest rivalry in Plantagenet history. Richard is a king, with the ego to match, but none of the political or interpersonal skills that would help in the role. Henry, however, has all the qualities you’d want in a monarch, except the right to rule, and soon they face off in an epic clash.

      <title>Season 5 | 1. Generation Kill</title>
      <description>Edward I is getting too old to fight his enormous list of enemies, and so begins handing over the reins of war to his son and a brand new generation of knights. But the old king has a gnawing feeling he can’t shake – does his heir have what it takes to rule, or is this the beginning of the end for the Plantagenets?

      <title>The Iron King | 3. The Pope Slap</title>
      <description>Philip the Fair’s vindictive nature ignites when a drunken bishop mouths off about him, calling him “a useless owl”. Possibly not the most devastating burn, but Philip isn’t one to suffer insults, however slight. This sets him on the path to collide with another of Europe’s massive egos, The Pope. Things escalate into a truly deranged smear campaign and culminate in, arguably, the most blasphemous slap in history.

      <description>Henry III’s mild and agreeable nature attracts all sorts of ambitious hangers-on and manipulators into the royal court. The most dangerous of these is a pious nobleman called Simon de Montfort. Simon easily charms the King, worming his way right into both Henry’s inner-circle and even his family.

      <title>Season 4 | 2. Brothers in Arms </title>
      <description>Henry III’s younger brother Richard returns from victory abroad and is rewarded with a wealthy area of English land. There’s just one problem: Henry has already granted key pieces of that land to someone else. This insult sends a furious Richard down the well-trodden path to family rebellion and civil war, while Henry desperately tries to stop things from spiralling out of control.

      <description>What happens when you make a nine-year-old boy king of England? It turns out, it’s a recipe for unscrupulous advisers and a king unlike any the nation has ever known.



Henry III is the opposite of his cruel father: he is compassionate and pious, but he’s also indecisive and easily manipulated. When trouble brews in Plantagenet lands in France, Henry’s brother, the wily and calculating Richard, is sent to assert the Plantagenet authority. It’s a decision that Henry and his advisors will come to sorely regret. .

      <title>Season 3 | 6. The Vendetta</title>
      <description>This episode contains scenes that some listeners may find upsetting.



One of King John’s closest allies, William de Briouze, knows exactly who murdered Arthur of Brittany. When his wife, Matilda, makes a public accusation, the King does everything in his power to take revenge. John may already have a reputation for cruelty, and a vicious streak, but what happens next shakes the people of England to their core.

      <title>Season 3 | 5. The Road to Hell</title>
      <description>King John makes a brand new enemy: Pope Innocent III, after they fall out over an archbishop. The Pope takes extreme measures and puts England under an interdict. This means the church is closed for business to everyone in England. He expects John to beg for mercy, but instead, the diabolical king has eyed a golden opportunity.

      <title>Season 3 | 4. Return of the King</title>
      <description>John has been chased from his lands in Normandy, and is forced into permanent residence in England. The problem is, the people of England have got quite used to absentee kings, and aren’t taking too kindly to John’s meddling. But John’s meddling has a serious purpose; he needs England’s wealth in order to raise an army and return to France to win back his lost lands.

      <title>Season 2 | 12. Richard Interrupted</title>
      <description>Richard has worn down French King Philip into agreeing a truce, but still has plenty of enemies to take care of. He heads to a castle in Aquitaine to teach the rebellious lord there a lesson. The Lionheart has won countless sieges and these defenders don’t look well prepared, so he jumps into the action himself. But fate is about to intervene, changing the Plantagenet world forever.

      <title>Season 1 | 22. Crusade Fever</title>
      <description>Religious fervour sweeps over the Plantagenet realms, as the Pope demands that all good Christians go to war and reclaim the Holy Land. Richard the Lionheart signs up and “takes the cross” immediately. This leaves Henry II with two concerns: will his son and heir survive this impulsive decision, and how weak will the old king look if he stays behind?

      <description>Henry is still determined to give his youngest son, John, some land of his own to rule and Ireland seems the obvious choice. So John is sent over there with a huge warchest and a clear mission: assert Plantagenet authority and ‘persuade’ the tribes to fall in line. He can then rule Ireland as part of his father’s empire. It’s a golden opportunity. All he needs to do is not mess it up…

      <title>Season 1 | 15. The Lionheart</title>
      <description>While Henry the Young King lives the glamorous tournament lifestyle, his brother Richard is proving himself on real battlefields. The most formidable general of all the Plantagenet princes, he rules Aquitaine with an iron fist, crushing rebellions, smashing castles, and generally making a name for himself as someone you really don’t want to cross. But as another wave of unrest sweeps through the province, things are about to get painfully personal for Richard.

We join Henry the Young King at one of the grandest tournaments of the age, determined to show the world what a real warrior looks like. But his opponents have other ideas…

      <description>The War Without Love is decisively won. This leaves Henry II with some tricky decisions to make about how to punish the rebels, including his own family. If he’s too lenient, people will think he’s weak. If he’s too harsh, they might rebel again. In the end, there’s just one person who ends up bearing the full brunt of Henry’s wrath: his wife.

      <title>Season 1 | 5. The Ringmaster</title>
      <description>This episode contains descriptions of violence or sexual content that may not be suitable for all listeners. 



A new character enters the drama. Thomas Becket has come out of nowhere to become Henry’s powerful right-hand man. Now he’s entrusted with what seems to be an impossible mission: he must persuade a hostile King Louis VII of France – Eleanor’s bitter ex-husband – to accept a marriage alliance between his own daughter and a Plantagenet prince. It would take a political mastermind to pull this one off…

Until yesterday, Eleanor of Aquitaine was the queen of France. Now, divorced and dethroned, she’s running for her life. Noblemen are lying in wait to capture her and lay claim to her lands. But, if she can escape them, and reach her destination in time, she’ll become more powerful than ever before. This is the beginning of the bloodiest dynasty in European history.
