Was the clip unfair? In stepping in, did the Home Office act out of order?

Putin had spent his 70th birthday weekend watching his precious road bridge that linked Crimea to mainland Russia blown to pieces. And today was his fightback. Revenge served just two days cold. 

75 missiles launched at targets across Ukraine. Poeple on their way to work. Parks, children’s playgrounds all the seemingly pointless target of Putin’s anger. 
We hear from John Sweeney - in his shower as the shells hit Kyiv - and from the US special envoy to Ukraine and former NATO Ambassador Kurt Volker. 
And  - for a bit of light relief we return to domestic politics, where the guilts are soaring, the new date for the fiscal budget has been set and the personal changes are multiple. We hear it from the scoop monster that is George Parker, Political Editor of the FT.

The Prime Minister, who’d insisted just yesterday her top rate tax cut was here to stay, decided… it wasn’t. By 7am this morning the whole policy had been ditched. Changes in unpopular policy can be a good thing. But if Liz Truss and her chancellor thought this would end the conversation, they’re in for a shock. Today, the questions are coming faster than ever: is Liz Truss still in charge? Who’s really wielding the power? And can Kwasi Kwarteng survive this? We ask the Business Secretary, Jacob Rees-Mogg. 

Also - the Brazil election was looking like a shoe-in for the opposition candidate and former president Lula de Silva. Until it wasn’t. The populist incumbent Bolsonaro is performing better - at least in the first round - than anyone predicted.
Why are pollsters still not getting the true picture from those who vote for populists?
