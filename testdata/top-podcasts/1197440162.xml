We hear all about Aldcroft's leadership style and what motivates her to always go the extra mile. She also revisits the heartbreak of losing to the All Blacks in the last World Cup final and how it affected her love for the game. Head coach John Mitchell explains the reasons behind the change of captain and what qualities he admires most in Aldcroft.
