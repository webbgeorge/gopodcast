      <title>Kylie on Who She’s Rooting For in Super Bowl, Mile Gut Checks &amp; Vogue Cover with Gabby Thomas | Ep. 8</title>
      <link>https://lnk.to/j61XD8</link>
      <description>Kylie’s back for a new episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Dunkin’ and kicks things off by reacting to fan submissions for the official name of the NGL fan base (1:58). Keep your ideas coming and tag us @nglwithkylie on social!
Then, Kylie gets honest about feeling conflicted about the Eagles-Chiefs Super Bowl rematch and answers the question everyone has been asking: who will she be rooting for in New Orleans (4:02)? Kylie also debuts a new segment: Doomscroll of the Week where she weighs in on Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper’s new TikTok content creator era (10:25). 
After that, three time gold medalist sprinter and “Vogue” cover star Gabby Thomas joins Kylie to talk about her time at the Paris Olympics and all the events they got to take in (15:35). Kylie also asks Gabby about the biggest misconceptions about sprinters vs. distance runners (20:23).
Gabby and Kylie then discuss the recent viral clip of USA Rugby star Ilona Maher telling an interviewer that she does not have imposter syndrome (25:40). Gabby shares her thoughts as a fellow elite athlete often faced with that question.
Plus, Kylie asks Gabby about her reaction to finding out she was going to be on the cover of Vogue (31:04) and if track meets need to start incorporating tunnel shots for pregame ‘fit moments (32:45). Kylie and Gabby then discuss their shared experiences working with kids on the autism spectrum and Gabby delves further into her work at a volunteer health clinic in Austin (37:30).
As always, you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from Kylie’s conversation with Gabby Thomas on YouTube on Monday. Make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss a thing!

      <link>https://lnk.to/j61XD8</link>
      <description>Kylie’s back for another episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Dunkin’ and starts off the show by thanking all of you for getting the podcast nominated for its first award (1:25)! Kylie then shouts out some NGLers in the mentions for supporting her minivan future and also hating on kids clothes with buttons (2:45).
Kylie then talks about how she got “roped into” being the announcer on Jason’s brand new show “They Call It Late Night” on ESPN (6:03). And now that baby girl has “popped,” so has pregnancy commentary, so Kylie shares her Do’s &amp; Don’ts of Talking to Pregnant Women (8:32).
After that, U.S. Women’s National Team icon and fellow mother and pregnant person Alex Morgan joins the show (14:38) to talk about her recent retirement from soccer and how her timeline shifted a bit when she found out she was expecting (19:34).
Alex and Kylie discuss their pregnancies, the transition from being a mother of one to two kids and how stressful it can be to land on a baby name (16:13). Kylie also asks Alex about playing while pregnant (24:40) and her legacy off the field, highlighting her pivotal role in achieving equal pay for the USWNT (31:55). 
Alex also discusses her women's sports media and commerce company, Togethxr, which also created the viral “Everyone Watches Women’s Sports” t-shirts and how she’s feeling about the current state of women’s sports (28:15). 
As Kylie mentions, these episodes are capped at 45 minutes so you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from her conversation with Alex Morgan on YouTube on Monday. Make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss a thing!

      <title>Kylie on Inevitable Minivan Future, Online Clapbacks &amp; Body Neutrality with Drew Afualo | Ep. 4</title>
      <link>https://lnk.to/j61XD8</link>
      <description>Kylie’s back for her fourth episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Dunkin’ and “shockingly” isn’t a New Year’s resolutions person so instead, she’s starting off this episode and the year 2025 with her official list of “Ins &amp; Outs” (1:46).
Kylie gets honest about the inevitability of a Kelce family minivan once baby number four arrives, her go-to drink at a bar and the one makeup item she’s stayed true to since 2007. She then declares what’s out in 2025, highlighting the worst types of baby clothes and the Dallas Cowboys postseason (7:22).
Then, Drew Afualo, viral content creator, hit podcast host and New York Times bestselling author, joins Kylie to talk about her beginnings on TikTok and being named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list (13:19).
Kylie and Drew then delve into their mutual love-hate relationship with social media comment sections (19:56). Since Drew made a name for herself by creating viral “clapback” video responses to rude commenters, Kylie has Drew “Coach Her Up” in a new segment (23:35).
Drew then bonds with Kylie over their shared experiences being bullied growing up for being tall (33:56). Drew explains how she’s since changed her thinking about body image and how she now views words like “fat” and “big” (39:05). 
As Kylie mentions, these episodes are capped at 45 minutes so you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from her conversation with Drew Afualo on YouTube on Monday. Make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss a thing!

      <title>Kylie on Deadbeat Elf on Shelf, Cat Timeline &amp; Choice to Not Have Kids with Charissa Thompson | Ep. 3</title>
      <link>https://lnk.to/j61XD8</link>
      <description>Kylie’s back for another episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Dunkin’ and is kicking off the show by answering some of your most popular questions, including the latest on adopting a kitten (2:30). Kylie wanted an “Ask Me Anything” but based on some of the responses, she’s rebranding it… Ask Me *Some* Things.
And since Christmas is right around the corner, Kylie gets honest about “Elf on the Shelf,” specifically the Kelce family Elf who Wyatt named M&amp;M-Y (7:15). Kylie explains M&amp;M-Y’s low maintenance lifestyle and her main concern about kids comparing elf notes.
Then, Charissa Thompson, host of Thursday Night Football and Fox NFL Kickoff joins Kylie to talk where they first met many years ago (13:10), as well as the first time they actually got to hang out properly earlier this year (16:20).
Kylie also asks Charissa about her work as the host of “TNF,” the process of getting camera ready and the dynamic between Charissa and the rest of the analysts on the desk (20:40).
Charissa talks about her desire to uplift other women in the sports world (29:53) and why she and Erin Andrews decided to start a podcast together (34:25). Kylie then asks Charissa about a topic she’s been open about: her choice to not have kids and how she ultimately arrived at that decision (36:52).
As Kylie mentions in the show, these episodes are capped at 45 minutes so you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from her conversation with Charissa Thompson on YouTube on Monday. Make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss a thing!

      <title>Kylie on Worst Kid Gifts, NFL “Team Moms” &amp; Raising Kids in Spotlight with Allison Kuch | Ep. 2</title>
      <link>https://lnk.to/j61XD8</link>
      <description>Kylie’s back for her second episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Dunkin’ and is once again baffled by your support and ability to get this “rookie” to the top of the charts. Kylie shares what the response has been like to the show, including Jason’s reaction (1:03).
Next, feeling festive, Kylie gives you her brutally honest “Please Don’t Buy This For My Children” Guide to Holiday Shopping (3:24). So if you’re still doing some toy shopping for the kids in your life, make sure to take a look at this to avoid upsetting the parents in your life.
Then, Allison Kuch, content creator, podcaster and one of Kylie’s favorite all-time follows, joins NGL to talk about the first year as a new mom (13:15), celebrating her daughter’s birthday in Disney and her thoughts on sharing kids on social media (22:06).
As a fellow football wife, Allie and Kylie also bond over the communities of women they’ve gotten to be a part of in the NFL (25:09). Allie dubs Kylie the Eagles “Team Mom” after Kylie shares she realized she was the oldest spouse on the team at one point (27:45).
Kylie also asks Allie about her start as a content creator, as well as her efforts to get more women invested in the NFL via her podcast “Sunday Sports Club" (40:30).
As Kylie mentions at the end of the show, these episodes are capped at 45 minutes so you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from her conversation with Allison Kuch on YouTube on Monday. Make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss a thing!

      <title>Kylie on Pregnancy Reaction, Parenting with Jason &amp; Raising Boys vs Girls with Kaitlin Olson | Ep. 1</title>
      <link>https://lnk.to/j61XD8</link>
      <description>The first-ever episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Dunkin’ is officially here and Kylie has a lot to catch you up on since the “Kelce” documentary and her appearance on “that other podcast taping in the other room.”
Kylie starts things off by thanking all of you for your overwhelming support of the show announcement and trailer (4:48). But don’t think she didn’t also notice some of the commentary about her swearing in front of her kids… (7:31)
Kylie then does her own spin on the game “20 Questions” she calls “5-ish Questions” because she’s a mom and nobody has time for 20 questions! Kylie talks about her recent pregnancy announcement (11:14), gives her thoughts on gender reveals (14:16), shares what the past two years have been like (19:38) and also reveals which incredible place she felt she had the least business being (22:06).
Kaitlin Olson then joins the show to talk to Kylie after being the winning bidder on her signed Eagles jacket (25:22). Kylie and Kaitlin discuss the differences between raising all boys vs. raising all girls (28:49) and moments they had early on in motherhood where they didn’t know what they were doing (32:00). 
Kaitlin also talks about her new show “High Potential” on ABC and branching out to roles that differ from “Sweet Dee” on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia" (37:28). Plus, staying true to the premise of the show, Kylie reveals an “It’s Always Sunny” related admission to Kaitlin (40:15).
As Kylie mentions in this episode, you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from her conversation with Kaitlin on YouTube throughout the week. Make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss a thing!
