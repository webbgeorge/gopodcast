						<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sometimes you have to just power through the self-loathing. Doing stand up comedy has helped Joanne McNally build resilience, take responsibility, and not take things so personally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this chat, Fearne and Joanne share experiences of being hyper-independent; but can trusting and relying on yourself go too far? They chat about learning to delegate and ask for help too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Joanne was adopted as a baby, and she opens up about the process of piecing her identity together when she met her birth parents. Are you able to find the funny in distressing periods of your life?

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Sociopathy should be understood as a spectrum disorder. It’s a disorder that affects roughly 5% of the population – similar to the number of people who have depression or anxiety. Patric Gagne is a sociopath.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this chat with Fearne, Patric explains the difference between a psychopath and a sociopath. Sociopaths have access to inherent emotions like sadness and happiness, but struggle with learned social emotions like remorse, guilt, empathy, and love. There’s also a huge feeling of apathy for Patric, which in the past led her to anti-social behaviours like stealing cars and breaking into houses.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fearne also points out the benefits of not caring what others think of you; while she people pleases a lot, she can see the freedom in having a lack of a filter. They chat about how to function in a relationship when you have to communicate any kind of mental disorder or illness too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Patric’s memoir, Sociopath, is this month’s Happy Place Book Club read.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Ask your inner child what brings them most joy: that’s how we can start to find happiness and purpose as adults. DJ, producer, singer, and songwriter John Newman has recently pivoted his career in order to better serve his inner child.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this chat with Fearne, John talks about how rejection in his childhood, coupled with the intoxicating feeling of being wanted by everyone as a famous artist, led him down a volatile path. Fame, he says, is a drug that was having an impact on those around him as well as himself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They also chat about what happens when you’re fearful of letting anything ‘negative’ touch you, as well as what impact being aware of death from a young age can have.Through doing the inner work, inviting practices such as manifestation into his life, and reconnecting with his innate passion for music,&nbsp;John is entering his most exciting chapter yet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>John’s smash hit single Call Your Name, with DJ/producer Alesso, is out now.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Born with a facial difference that meant he felt he didn’t fit in, Jono Lancaster has spent a lifetime practicing self-acceptance. Having been abandoned at birth, his adoptive mum provided immense support and care, but the confidence he felt at home was often chipped away at by the rest of the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this chat with Fearne, Jono talks about how severe lows have forced him to take control of his inner narrative, transforming those lows into strength. He also explains why representation of facial differences is so important on TV and in film, and the positive impact it would have on his own sense of self if it wasn’t just the villains who have scars, burns, and other differences.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>CONTENT WARNING: This episode contains frank conversation about suicidal ideation, so do take care while listening.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Jono’s book, Not All Heroes Wear Capes, is published by Happy Place Books on July 20th, and is available to pre-order now.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>Olympian Dame Kelly Holmes recently announced publicly that she is gay. Although she’s acknowledged this truth privately for a number of decades, it’s only now that she’s felt able to begin living publicly her authentic self. Having served in the British military at a time when homosexuality was banned, Kelly had always feared serious repercussions, which only intensified when she became a celebrated world class athlete.</p><br><p>In this chat with Fearne, Kelly talks through the painful – and hopeful – journey that’s brought her to a place where she feels confident to live entirely authentically, as well as delving into the mental, emotional, and physical stress of hiding such a huge part of her identity for so long.</p><br><p>Kelly Holmes: Being Me is available to watch back on ITV Hub.</p><br><p>CONTENT WARNING: This episode contains frank chat about self harm, so take care while listening.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Spiritual guide and teacher Giselle La Pompe Moore is determined to help us return to our authentic selves.</p><br><p>In this chat, Fearne and Giselle share their belief that spirituality isn’t an elite club that centres around buying stuff. Physical items like crystals, sage, or tarot cards can be a wonderful addition if you ascribe meaning to them, but fundamentally being spiritual is about using your own mental power to find joy, bliss, and peace in every day life.</p><br><p>Giselle’s book ‘Take It In: Do The Inner Work. Create Your Best Damn Life’ is out now.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Meik Wiking is the CEO of the Happiness Research Institute, based in Denmark, and he feels we’d all be happier if we focused more on the smaller choices we can control. That, he explains, is where the Danish art of hygge comes in.</p><p>In this chat with Fearne, Meik explores why policy makers would do well to consider the happiness of their country as an important element of national health – happy citizens are more likely to earn more, less likely need the health service, and more likely to perform random acts of kindness.</p><p>Meik’s books, The Little Book of Hygge, The Little Book of Lykke, and The Art of Making Memories are all out now.</p><p>Thanks to Stripe and Stare for sponsoring this series of Happy Place.
