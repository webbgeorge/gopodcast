						<description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome back to Stick to Football, brought to you by SkyBet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, we’re thrilled to welcome a true legend of English football in Glenn Hoddle who joins hosts Gary Neville, Roy Keane, Ian Wright, and Jill Scott.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We start by exploring Glenn’s unique style as a player ahead of his time, and move on to his picks for the current England team. The panel dives into a debate on Thomas Tuchel managing England and Glenn’s time working with Arsène Wenger at Monaco.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Glenn reflects on his flair for scoring from outside the box, his experience as a player-manager, and those who influenced his career. He also opens up about the challenges of taking on the England manager role and making tough decisions like leaving Gazza out of his 1998 World Cup squad.</p><br><p>Plus, Glenn shares personal moments, including his first heart scare and his life-threatening heart attack at BT Studios. The episode wraps up with his thoughts on England's chances of another major tournament victory - and Tottenham's struggles to win more trophies.</p><br><p>Thank you for listening. Don't forget to subscribe - and leave us a five-star review to help others find the show.</p><br><p>Sky Bet have partnered with British Heart Foundation since May 2024.
