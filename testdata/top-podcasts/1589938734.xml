Case 1: The Haunting of Hollymount Farm</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Danny Robins hosts the visualised podcast for real-life supernatural encounters. </p><p>The Haunting of Hollymount Farm is the story of Liam and the terrifying events growing up on his family farm.  </p><p>Throughout his childhood Liam experiences strange activity, including seeing a ghostly sighting of a little boy. For years Liam thinks he’s alone in his experiences, but when his parents finally open up, Liam discovers that not only had they also seen things – including the little boy and a strange hooded figure - but his grandparents had odd experiences dating all the way back to the 1960s. </p><p>We ended the TV episode with the extraordinary revelation that the farm was previously on the grounds of an orphanage, run by nuns. Could that explain the little boy and the hooded figure?</p><p>In this extended podcast episode of Uncanny: Post Mortem, Danny Robins delves deeper into the haunting of Hollymount Farm, uncovering fresh evidence, new leads and revelations about this chilling case. It's a case so intriguing and frightening, it demands further discussion. Is it genuine paranormal activity, or could there be a scientific explanation behind it all?</p><p>Assisting Danny in his search for answers are celebrity guest and Ghosts actor Kiell Smith-Bynoe, to discuss the stand-out moments in the episode; regular paranormal experts Dr Ciarán O’Keeffe and Evelyn Hollow, who further analyse the farm’s unsettling poltergeist activity; and witness Liam, who adds additional insights into this dark and disturbing story.</p><p>Written and presented by Danny Robins
