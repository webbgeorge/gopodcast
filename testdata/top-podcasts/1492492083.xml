      <title>#164 Mike Grover - How Hacking Tools Are Changing Cyber Warfare</title>
      <description>Mike Grover is a security researcher, InfoSec expert, and the creator of the infamous O.MG Cable. He gained prominence in 2019 when he showcased his malicious USB cable prototype at DEF CON, capable of recording keystrokes and executing remote commands. Grover's O.MG Cable looks identical to a regular charging cable, but contains a tiny implant that creates a Wi-Fi hotspot, allowing attackers to access the connected device from up to 300 feet away.

Since its inception, Grover has refined the O.MG Cable design, making it indistinguishable from normal USB cables and expanding its capabilities. The latest iteration includes features such as geofencing, self-destruct mechanisms, and support for various connector types including Lightning and USB-C. Grover's work aims to raise awareness about hardware security risks while providing tools for red teams and security researchers to test and improve organizational defenses.

      <title>#163 Gary Brecka - Biohacking Secrets to Longevity, Aging Myths and the Science of Nutrition</title>
      <description>Gary’s journey began in the insurance industry as a mortality-modeling expert, predicting lifespans with astonishing precision. In this role he used medical records and demographic data to predict how long someone would live, down to the month. This precise, data-driven approach to human life deepened Gary’s fascination with blood chemistry and the biomarkers of longevity.
Determined to shift from forecasting life spans to extending them, Gary set off on a quest to optimize these biomarkers and uncover the secrets to a longer, healthier life.
Gary realized that understanding and manipulating the very elements that determine life expectancy could revolutionize personal health and wellness. This revelation inspired him to delve deeper into the science of human biology, seeking out the latest research and collaborating with leading experts in the field.
Today, his work is revolutionizing the lives of thousands, including top athletes, CEOs, and celebrities. To further his mission Gary launched The Ultimate Human, a platform where he shares his extensive knowledge through regular wellness challenges.
He also hosts the “The Ultimate Human” podcast, where his mission is to empower his audience with the knowledge and tools to achieve peak performance and vitality.

      <title>#160 Tim Sheehy - Former Navy SEAL &amp; Aerial Firefighter Breaks Down the Los Angeles Wildfires</title>
      <description>Tim Sheehy is a distinguished politician and former Navy SEAL, known for his leadership and commitment to public service. He served in the U.S. Navy for over a decade, participating in numerous combat missions and earning commendations such as the Bronze Star and the Navy Commendation Medal. Sheehy then moved into the private sector and founded Bridger Aerospace, an aerial firefighting company operating across the US - most recently in Los Angeles in the Palisades and Eaton Canyon wildfires.

In 2024 he left Bridger Aerospace to run for public office, aiming to bring his military experience and business acumen to government. He emphasizes policies that support small businesses, improve healthcare access for veterans, and enhance national security measures. His book “Mudslingers: A True Story of Aerial Firefighting” chronicles the history of aerial firefighting operations in the US with 100% of proceeds going to firefighters injured or killed in the line of duty.

      <title>#158 Călin Georgescu - Does Romania's Coup Reveal NATO's Desperation to Push WW3?</title>
      <description>Călin Georgescu is a prominent Romanian politician, agronomist, and frontrunner of the contested 2024 Romanian presidential election. He holds a Ph.D. in pedology from the University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest, served as the Executive Director of the National Centre for Sustainable Development in Romania from 2000 to 2013, coordinated Romania's National Sustainable Development Strategy, and held positions as Executive Director of the UN Global Sustainable Index Institute and President of the European Research Centre for the Club of Rome.

In the 2024 Romanian presidential election, Georgescu emerged as a surprise frontrunner over pro-Western candidate Elena Lasconi, winning the first round with 22.95% of the votes. His campaign focused on national development, sovereignty, and reducing Romania's dependence on imports. The results were then annulled by the sitting Romanian government following allegations of Russian interference and the use of undeclared campaign funds - drawing comparisons to recent political turmoil in the USA.

      <title>#156 Chris Fettes - A SEAL Team 6 Sniper’s Worst Nightmare</title>
      <description>Chris Fettes, a former Navy SEAL, served for 13 years with SEAL Team 10 and Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU), deploying to combat zones in Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. During his military career, Fettes developed a passion for making ice cream, often bringing his high-end Italian ice cream machine on deployments. He would create frozen treats for his teammates and even distribute ice cream to local children in war-torn areas.

After leaving the military in 2016, Fettes pursued his passion for ice cream making by enrolling in Penn State University's Ice Cream Short Course. In 2022, he launched Be Free Craft Ice Cream, an artisanal, small-batch ice cream company based in Virginia Beach. Fettes' business pays homage to his military roots with flavors like ‘Cookie Commandough’ and ‘Pointman Pistachio.’ He is currently exploring his next venture of opening a brick-and-mortar shop in Virginia Beach.

She was among the select few trained in "remote viewing," a form of controlled clairvoyance, and applied this skill to support government intelligence efforts during her time with Stargate.

      <title>#142 Dale Stark - A-10 Warthog: One of the Most Feared Aircraft in History</title>
      <description>Dale Stark, a retired Lieutenant Colonel and accomplished A-10 Warthog pilot, served nearly 24 years in the Air Force, initially enlisting as an aircraft mechanic before commissioning as an officer. Known for his skill in close air support (CAS), Stark deployed to Afghanistan in 2006, 2010, and 2014, becoming a trusted squadron commander in 2018. His leadership style emphasized teamwork and discipline, values that guided his ascent through the ranks and earned him the respect of his airmen during critical missions in the Global War on Terror.
Returning to, Oregon, Stark and his wife Amanda established a small-scale cattle ranch, inspired by his love for agriculture. They aim to produce and provide healthy, local beef for their community, combining sustainable practices with a commitment to wellness and quality food. Stark also hosts his own podcast "The Dale Stark Show," a show dedicated to telling the stories of those who served.

      <title>#141 Father Dan Reehil - Inside the Demonic World with an Exorcist</title>
      <description>Father Dan Reehil is a Catholic priest who transitioned from a successful Wall Street career to the priesthood after a life-changing pilgrimage to Medjugorje in 1998. This spiritual conversion led him to leave New York after 9/11 and begin priestly formation in Boston. He was ordained in 2014 and now serves as the exorcist for the Diocese of Nashville and pastor of St. Catherine of Siena Parish in Columbia, Tennessee.
In addition to his pastoral duties, Father Reehil is the National Director of Radio Maria USA, where he hosts the program "Battle Ready," focusing on spiritual topics. He is also a sought-after speaker on issues of faith, exorcism, and spiritual warfare, drawing from his unique experiences.

      <title>#140 Eli Crane &amp; Tim Burchett - Two Things All Americans Want: Accountability and Transparency</title>
      <description>In this gripping episode of SRS, we dive into the raw realities of American politics with special guests Congressman Tim Burchett (TN) and Congressman Eli Crane (AZ). Together, they unpack the Secret Service's failure to adequately protect former President Donald Trump and the conspiracies surrounding these incidents. They also explore the dark undercurrents of government corruption and how hidden agendas manipulate the corridors of power, impacting policy decisions and American lives alike.
The congressmen also pull back the curtain on what really happens behind closed doors in Congress, exposing the unexpected alliances, the bitter rivalries, and the influence of special interests shaping key legislation. With firsthand insights and candid commentary, this episode is a must-listen for anyone seeking an unfiltered look at the inner workings of government—and the challenges of maintaining transparency and accountability in today’s political landscape.

      <title>#135 Scott Mann - The Real Cost of America's Failures</title>
      <description>Scott Mann is a return SRS guest and retired Lt. Col. / Green Beret with an impressive military career that spanned over two decades, including multiple combat deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. Renowned for his leadership and expertise in unconventional warfare, Mann has dedicated his life to serving others, both in and out of uniform.
After retiring, he became a prominent advocate for veterans, focusing on mental health and the challenges they face after returning home. Mann co-founded Pineapple Express, an initiative that helped evacuate Afghan allies and their families during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. This grassroots effort highlighted his commitment to supporting those who stood by U.S. forces during their service.
In addition to his advocacy work, Mann authored "Nobody Is Coming to Save You: A Green Beret's Guide to Getting Big Sh*t Done," a powerful book that emphasizes personal responsibility and the importance of taking action in the face of adversity. Drawing from his military experiences and the lessons learned through his work with Pineapple Express, Mann inspires readers to become proactive in their own lives and communities.

She was elected to the Hawaii State Legislature in 2002 at just 21, becoming the youngest person ever elected in the state.

Elected to the Honolulu City Council in 2010, Tulsi chaired the Safety, Economic Development, and Government Affairs Committee and vice-chaired the Budget Committee. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012, where she is one of the first female combat veterans to serve.
Gabbard's political career has been focused on veterans' issues, strategic decisions, and sustainable economic policies. She remains dedicated to affordable health care, quality education, and economic prosperity for all Americans.

      <title>#130 JD Vance - Why Have a Government if it's Not Functioning?</title>
      <description>Today, we have the privilege of sitting down with JD Vance, a man who has become a critical voice in American politics. JD Vance, known for his bestselling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, is Donald Trump's VP pick and has built a reputation for his deep understanding of Middle America and its struggles. On this solemn day, 9/11, JD shares not only where he was on that fateful day but also the tragic stories from this sober anniversary, reflecting on how the events shaped the course of his life and his decision to enlist in the Marine Corps. He highlights the wave of enlistments that followed 9/11 and contrasts it with today's troubling decline in recruitment.
In this episode, we dive deep into Vance’s views on pressing issues like the Biden-Harris administration’s funding of terrorism and the ongoing war in Ukraine. We explore the troubling amount of taxpayer dollars being spent overseas while American families face financial struggles at home. JD also shares his insight on Israel, the crisis at the border, government reform, and the evolving role of AI technology. This conversation not only covers current policy challenges but also explores JD Vance's vision for addressing these critical issues facing our nation.

      <title>#128 Kash Patel - FBI Spying on Americans, Russiagate and Biden’s Classified Documents</title>
      <description>Kash Patel is an American political figure and attorney known for his roles in national security and intelligence. He served as a U.S. National Security Council official, senior advisor to the Acting Director of National Intelligence, and Chief of Staff to the Acting United States Secretary of Defense during the Trump Presidency.
Patel's career began as a public defender, where he managed complex criminal cases. He later worked as a terrorism prosecutor at the Department of Justice (DOJ), leading high-profile investigations and prosecutions against terror groups like Al-Qa’ida and ISIS. He also served as the DOJ Liaison Officer to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Patel now works with his foundation to provide legal funds for whistleblowers within the federal government.

      <title>#127 President Donald J. Trump - Make America Great Again</title>
      <description>Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States and is now running for a second term. In June 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election as a Republican. Unlike the politicians before him, President Trump had a unique style and message that energized the American public. His appeal to many Americans stemmed from his status as a political outsider and his portrayal as a break from traditional career politicians.
During and after his presidency, Trump faced significant opposition and controversy from the establishment, including two impeachments by the House of Representatives—first in 2019 over abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again in 2021 over incitement of insurrection related to the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021. He was acquitted by the Senate in both cases. Most recently, there was an attempt on his life when a gunman opened fire during a rally in Pennsylvania, wounding the President and two spectators, and killing one supporter.
Today, President Trump is running on a platform dedicated to strong border and immigration policies, lowering taxes and inflation, achieving energy independence, and ending the weaponization of the media and government agencies. In this episode of SRS, Shawn met with the President in Las Vegas to discuss his vision for the future and how he intends to "make America great again."

      <title>#125 Gina Carano - Disney Crumbles After Mandalorian Star Uses Beep, Bop, Boop for Pronouns</title>
      <description>Gina Carano is an actor and former mixed martial artist. Her fighting career rose to critical acclaim in the mid 2000's when she competed in Elite Xtreme Combat and Strikeforce, boasting a 7–1 record. After retiring from her fighting career, Carano took Hollywood by storm, landing roles in Fast &amp; Furious 6, Deadpool, and Disney's The Mandalorian. Her time in the spotlight would be cut short when Lucasfilm announced in February 2021 that Carano would not appear in future Star Wars episodes following a series of controversial posts she made to social media. Despite enormous pressure and public scrutiny, Carano has stood firm by her beliefs and paved the way for a new career independent of Hollywood agendas.

      <itunes:summary>Gina Carano is an actor and former mixed martial artist. Her fighting career rose to critical acclaim in the mid 2000's when she competed in Elite Xtreme Combat and Strikeforce, boasting a 7–1 record. After retiring from her fighting career, Carano took Hollywood by storm, landing roles in Fast &amp; Furious 6, Deadpool, and Disney's The Mandalorian. Her time in the spotlight would be cut short when Lucasfilm announced in February 2021 that Carano would not appear in future Star Wars episodes following a series of controversial posts she made to social media. Despite enormous pressure and public scrutiny, Carano has stood firm by her beliefs and paved the way for a new career independent of Hollywood agendas.

      <title>#124 Captain Brad Geary - Inside the Failed Investigation and Tragic Death of Kyle Mullen</title>
      <description>Brad Geary is a Navy Captain and Commanding Officer at Naval Special Warfare Basic Training Command. Geary boasts an incredible twenty four year career in NSW. Captain Geary has completed numerous deployments throughout the world while serving in leadership positions at SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team Two, SEAL Team Four, and Naval Special Warfare Tactical Development and Evaluation Squadron Three.
Geary's career now hangs in the balance due to a Navy probe into the mysterious death of trainee and Seaman Kyle Mullen, who tragically lost his life during the infamous training period known as "Hell Week." The Navy investigation initially pinned blame on the training cadre, but as pressure from Congress and Geary's testimony grows, a different narrative is coming to light. Geary's attorney stated that "when all the key facts emerge, the Navy's improper actions will be exposed -- and it will be undeniable that Capt. Geary is being scapegoated as part of a larger scheme to cover up massive failures and abuses of power at the highest levels of the Navy."

      <title>#121 Cmdr. Ahmad Massoud - The Assassination that Changed the World</title>
      <description>Ahmad Massoud is the Commander of the National Resistance Front (NRF) of Afghanistan. Massoud is the son of the late anti-soviet and revolutionary commander, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and hails from the Province of Takhar in Northeast Afghanistan. After the assassination of his father in 2001, Ahmad and his family settled in the UK, where he completed his higher education and military training at the Sandhurst Military Academy. Ahmad received his bachelor’s degree in War Studies from Kings College London and his master’s degree in International Politics from City, University of London. 
After completing his education, Ahmad returned to Afghanistan and started his political movement. Supporters of his father declared him as the successor of the late Ahmad Shah Massoud. Now, he continues to advocate for the freedom of his people, appearing in the media and garnering support from allied nations.

      <title>#117 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. - CIA Propaganda &amp; Information Manipulation</title>
      <description>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an author, attorney, activist and 2024 Presidential Candidate. Kennedy is known for his family's long history of public service and his dissenting opinions that circle the rigid "Left" and "Right" view points. Kennedy has spent many years "fighting corrupt government agencies" and corporations alike. He has won environmental cases against dozens of municipalities and corporate giants like General Electric and ExxonMobil. Kennedy also co-founded the WaterKeeper Alliance, the world's largest nonprofit devoted to clean water, protecting 2.7 million miles of waterways. He is now running for President in 2024 and pledges to "end the forever wars, clean up government, and increase wealth for all."

      <title>#107 Legend - Biden Admin Sends Your Tax Dollars to the Taliban</title>
      <description>"Legend" is a former US Army Intel NCO and key member of Vets4NRF (National Resistance Front of Afghanistan). Legend joined the US Army at age seventeen and served on multiple deployments to the Middle East under the Department of of Defense during the Global War on Terror. He now supports the NRF, the last resistance against Taliban rule in the region.
Legend is risking his anonymity to bring information to light for the American people. Much in line with recently surfaced news reports, he provides an alternate account of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. Most frighteningly, he reveals that the United States is sending over forty million taxpayer dollars, per week, directly to the Taliban regime. Legend also shares the growing threats that Chinese alliances are building in the region.

      <title>#101 Michael Yon - Secrets of the Darién Gap</title>
      <description>Michael Yon is a Former Green Beret, Author, Photographer, and War Correspondent. After serving in the U.S. Army Special Forces, Yon retired his rifle in favor of a camera. He began his journalism career in December of 2004 in Iraq, covering some of the World's most complex conflicts and war zones. His writing and photography lead him to over 100 countries during his 20 year career. Most recently, he's been in South America covering an unknown path for illegal immigration into the United States: The Darién Gap.
The Darién Gap is a region that connects the Southernmost part of Panama and Northern Colombia. This area has become the preferred way of travel for hundreds of thousands of migrants since the late 2000's. The Darién Gap is largely unregulated and only maintained by a faltering assortment of NGOs and smugglers. In this episode, Yon breaks down how the region functions in illegal immigration and the growing threat it poses to U.S Sovereignty.

      <title>#99 John Crist - Beating Cancel Culture</title>
      <description>John Crist is a successful comedian with over one billion video views and is the host of his hilarious podcast "Net Positive." Crist is widely known for his viral videos like "Honest Football Coach," "Every Parent at Disney," and "Brands that need to be CANCELLED."
Crist's remarkably successful online presence was backed by a relentless touring schedule that initially favored christian audiences and churches rather than the typical theatre circuit. In this episode, Crist recounts his meteoric rise to fame that was ultimately sidelined by the #metoo movement and cancel culture that swept the nation in 2019. Shawn and John share deep conversation that wrestles with topics like faith, hypocrisy, mental health, and personal growth.

      <title>#98 Jonathan Wilson - Navy SEAL Operator</title>
      <description>Jonathan Wilson is a former Navy SEAL and Founder of INVI Mindhealth. This episode documents his life and work, on and off the battlefield. Wilson's interest was set on the military at an early age, as his Father was an MP and traveling around became the norm. He would eventually set his sights on the Naval Academy and Naval Special Warfare.
Wilson's early days were marked with mischief that nearly ended his career. Yet, through fate and luck, he made it to "Hell Week." He excelled in the SEAL Teams with a demanding op tempo and fighting in some of the worst combat zones like Sadr City. After multiple deployments, he left the SEAL Team's to explore a civilian career on Wall Street. The toll a high stress career at Goldman Sachs took on his family life and the lack of purpose ultimately lead him back to the Teams. After winding down his incredible career, he went on to start the Seal Future Foundation and INVI Mindhealth. INVI is a mobile app that "leverages the connectivity of the autonomic nervous system &amp; the mind to provide actionable analysis" of human biometrics. INVI's goal is to end the veteran suicide epidemic with monitoring and preventative measures.

      <title>#97 Rick Doblin -  MDMA Psychedelic Assisted Therapy</title>
      <description>Rick Doblin, Ph.D., is the Founder &amp; President of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and this episode is all about his life and work. This episode is a holistic look at the point where traditional therapy meets psychedelics and how Doblin and his team have spent the last few decades appealing to the scientific community and lawmakers across the world.
Doblin gives us a fresh perspective on the mental health crisis and discusses his studies &amp; experiments in Iceland. We cover his early professional life and what lead him to pursue the science of alternative medicines. Doblin believes that with psychedelic assisted therapy, the world could be trauma free by 2070.

      <title>#96 Col. John Alexander - Military Applications of the Paranormal</title>
      <description>Col. John Alexander is a former Army Special Forces Commander with an impeccable career in leadership across multiple agencies and programs within the U.S. intelligence community. Alexander lead Special Forces teams as an Officer during the Vietnam War. He would later serve as the Chief of Human Technology at INSCOM and Army Inspector General. Alexander's work inspired and was heavily featured in the book and adapted film "Men Who Stare at Goats." He is widely credited with leading the way in researching non-lethal weapons and military applications of the paranormal.
In this episode, Alexander recounts his experience in Vietnam and the brutality of jungle warfare. Through his experience, he began to see the power of coincidence and intuition. This led him to pursue greater knowledge via the Army Intelligence and Security Command. It was there he helped transform the United State's approach to the paranormal. Post retirement, Alexander became the Program Manager for Non-Lethal Defense at Los Alamos National Laboratory–the same lab responsible for the creation of the Atomic Bomb. Today, he is a successful Author and continues his work as a researcher.

      <title>#95 Joe McMoneagle - CIA's Project Stargate</title>
      <description>Joe McMoneagle is a former U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer and was among the first Remote Viewers to be recruited into the previously classified Stargate Project. Project Stargate was the United States' first organized research into psychic phenomena via the Defense Intelligence Agency and contractor SRI International.
In this episode, McMoneagle takes us back to the early days of the Vietnam War and how he was recruited into intelligence operations. The height of the Cold War fueled appetites for advantages over the United States' enemies and gave way to the CIA's push into "psychic and extra sensory perception" research and military applications.
Post his military retirement, McMoneagle authored several books to critical acclaim like "The Stargate Chronicles: Memoirs of a Psychic Spy" and continued his work via his private venture–Intuitive Intelligence Applications, Inc. He now teaches Remote Viewing at The Monroe Institute, a world leader in human consciousness exploration.

      <title>#94 Dom Raso - SEAL Team 6 / DEVGRU Operator</title>
      <description>Dom Raso is a former SEAL Team Six / DEVGRU Operator whose career spans across twelve years and multiple combat deployments during the Global War on Terror. Raso served in Gold Squadron, an outfit that suffered a staggering loss during an attack on August 6, 2011 when a Chinook CH-47 (call sign: Extortion 17) was shot down by insurgents. This was the most devastating day in SEAL Team Six history, as well as the single largest loss of life for U.S. forces since the war in Afghanistan began in 2001.
Raso is well known for his contributions to DEVGRU in the way of research and development and combative techniques. Post his military career, he took those same lessons learned to create his brand Crush Everything / Dynamis Alliance. As CEO, Raso seeks to prepare the next generation by embracing sacrifice and using it as a positive energy to "crush everything" that he does.

      <title>#90 Ryan Hendrickson - Green Beret, "Welcome to Afghanistan"</title>
      <description>This week, SRS is bringing you a special holiday episode just in time for Christmas. Ryan Hendrickson is an Army Special Forces Green Beret with over twenty two years of service and is a Silver Star recipient. Hendrickson is also an author and humanitarian, founding his organization "Tip of the Spear."
This episode covers Hendrickson's entire life story, from childhood to present day. Hendrickson explains his early career in the Navy and how he would ultimately pivot to being a Green Beret. Hendrickson had eight deployments to Afghanistan. In his first deployment, he was severely injured in an IED blast where Kyle Morgan, a previous SRS guest, carried him to safety.
Despite almost losing a leg, Hendrickson beat the odds and served on seven more deployments. This episode documents some of Hendrickson's most harrowing moments in combat. After his incredible career in the military, Hendrickson applied his skillset to an entirely new battlefield: Ukraine. Since the conflict began, Hendrickson has removed over 1,765 landmines with his humanitarian group "Tip of the Spear Landmine Removal.

      <title>#85 Bryce Case Jr. AKA YTCracker - Anonymous Hacker</title>
      <description>Bryce Case Jr., aka YTCracker, is a hacker and musician. Bryce has been called "The Original Digital Gangster" for his early adoption and manipulation of all things online. Ryan Montgomery, a fan favorite on SRS, calls Bryce his mentor.
In this special Holiday release, we cover Bryce's life story starting with his early exploits when the internet was just coming into itself. We discuss his aptitude for clever digital marketing and finding money-making opportunities in every corner of America Online.
Bryce made a name for himself in the hacking community by digitally defacing government websites like NASA and propping up coalitions of hackers across the web. A "Black Hat" now turned "White Hat," Bryce Case Jr. has repurposed his unscrupulous skill-set into a leading force for cybersecurity, working with some of the largest tech companies in the world.

      <title>#83 What Led Victor Marx to Become the World's Fastest Gun Disarmer | Part 1</title>
      <description>Victor Marx is a high risk humanitarian, former U.S. Marine, author, filmmaker, and lays claim to the World's fastest gun disarm.
This is a three part series that covers his life story. In part one, Marx recounts a childhood marked by severe abuse. By the time he graduated from high school, his lifestyle was filled with drugs, fights and theft. Yet, the discipline of the military and his steadfast faith would reset the course of his life. This episode is extremely graphic. Viewer / Listener discretion is advised.

      <title>#82 Luis Chaparro - Journalist with a $60,000 Bounty Breaks into Ovidio Guzmán's House | Part 1</title>
      <description>Luis Chaparro is a Journalist specializing in narcos, cartels, and immigration. This is his third appearance on SRS where he brings the most up-to-date information on the growing crises south of the border.
In part one, Chaparro updates us on the aftershock of a small scale war that thrust Mexico into a state of chaos when authorities captured Ovidio Guzman, son of drug lord El Chapo. In retaliation, hundreds of armed cartel members laid siege to multiple cities, occupying multiple areas, establishing blockades, and engaging in shootouts with authorities.

In part two, Adams exposes what was happening Stateside during the Benghazi attacks while U.S. Service Members were fighting for their lives. Shawn and Sarah discuss what measures could have been taken that night to provide support to the CIA Annex team on the ground.

      <title>#78 Tim Burchett - Inside UFO/UAP Government Programs | Part 1</title>
      <description>This week on SRS, we welcome Tennessee Congressman Tim Burchett to the show. Burchett is one of the few congressmen that is actively pursuing the uncovering of UAP / UFO phenomena, regardless of how much flak it may bring. Burchett put together the first hearing for Congress to seriously evaluate UAP / UFO reports in 50 years. Part one of this episode explores the origins of the newfound push to explain and investigate these occurrences.

      <title>#77 Tom Satterly -  The Battle of Mogadishu "Black Hawk Down" 30th Anniversary | Part 2</title>
      <description>This week on SRS, we welcome Command SGT Major (R), Tom Satterly to the show. Satterly is a former Delta Force Operator with over twenty years of combat experience. He has participated in operations all across the globe. We're breaking his incredible story into a three part series.
Part 2
Thirty years ago, on October 3, 1993, U.S. forces planned to seize two of Mohammed Farah Aidid's top lieutenants during a meeting deep in Mogadishu. The raid was only intended to last an hour, but exploded into an overnight standoff and rescue operation extending into the daylight hours of the next day. Operation Gothic Serpent would claim the lives of 18 U.S. service members–the deadliest battle since Vietnam. Tom Satterly was on the ground that day. This is his story.

      <title>#76 Erik Prince - 6 Enemies of Big Government, Combating Cartels and the Ukraine War | Part 1</title>
      <description>So much has been happening in the world over the last few months–the war in Ukraine, the value drops in the US dollar, a recession and political turmoil. SRS wanted to get insights from someone who can see beyond the veil. That's why we're welcoming back Erik Prince, Founder of Blackwater and American Entrepreneur, Former Navy Seal.
Prince explains the shifts in foreign policy and the looming dangers of a no-end war in Ukraine and the growing threat of the CCP. He shares his experiences contracting with the State Department and gives insights on what Capitol Hill is pushing. Shawn and Erik discuss the decline of American manufacturing and the security threats monopolies have created in business and politics. This episode is a "state of the union" from the perspective of one of the world's most experienced entrepreneurs.

Shawn and Nick also touch on the epidemic of mass shootings that have become the new normal for the United States. If you're struggling to make sense of your place in the world today, this episode is a must listen.

      <title>#74 Mark "Oz" Geist - 13 Hours Survivor Reflects on the Deadly Benghazi Attacks</title>
      <description>Today marks the 11th anniversary of the unprecedented attack on a U.S. Consulate and CIA Annex in Benghazi, Libya that claimed the lives of four Americans– J. Christopher Stevens (U.S. Ambassador), Sean Smith (U.S. Foreign Service Information Officer), Glen "Bub" Doherty (U.S. Navy SEAL / CIA), and Tyrone S. "Rone" Woods (U.S Navy Seal / CIA).
The aftermath of this attack resulted in ten investigations spanning two years that shook the core of American foreign policy and protocol within the State Department. The survivors would also consult on the critically acclaimed film "13 Hours" that depicted the attack, based on the book co-authored by the survivors.
SRS is honored to have Mark Geist, one of the surviving members of the Annex Security team, on to share his story. Mark Geist is a former Marine, Sheriff, and CIA Security Consultant / Contractor that fought off the attack and is credited with saving over twenty-five lives.

      <title>#72 Tony Cowden - CIA Operator Survives Deadly IED Blast that Sent Him to the Morgue | Part 2</title>
      <description>Former Green Beret and CIA contractor Tony Cowden is back in part two of this two-part series. Part one dove deep into his upbringing and early career. Now, we're getting into Ground Branch. Ground Branch is known for being the CIA's covert counterpart to Special Operations. Ground Branch has been active in many theaters of war–Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, though their actions are rarely covered in the media.
We cap off the episode with Tony's transition into civilian life and ultimately into a grueling campaign for Congress where he saw the hypocrisy and corruption of the USG first hand. Tony and Shawn discuss the state of America and what they believe is coming next.

      <title>#72 Tony Cowden - CIA Operator's Real Life John Wick-Style Gunfight in a Warzone | Part 1</title>
      <description>SRS is honored to bring Tony Cowden's story to the show. Tony is a former Green Beret and CIA contractor with an impeccable career having served in multiple combat deployments. In part one of this two-part series, we cover Tony's upbringing and how his father helped fuel his capacity for resourcefulness and an unmatched work ethic.
Tony recounts his experience in the "Red Cell" Program where he was tracking and surveilling assets on American soil and how he barely made it out of a sticky situation alive on the day of the September 11th, 2001 attacks. Don't miss the harrowing story of how Tony single-handedly held off wave after wave of attackers when he was cut off, alone and outnumbered in the streets of Iraq. 26 bodies of enemy combatants were recovered from this firefight.

      <title>#71 Vivek Ramaswamy - EXPOSES Deep State, BlackRock, Big Pharma, Central Bank Digital Currency</title>
      <description>Shawn Ryan Show is an open platform. Our goal is to bring truth and share untold stories that the media wouldn't otherwise cover. Part of that goal is to give the American people an opportunity to hear from their leaders and prospective leaders in a long format. We're done with the 15 second sound bytes. That's why 2024 Presidential Candidate Vivek Ramaswamy is on this week.
Vivek is the son of immigrants turned American success story and entrepreneur. After graduating from Harvard, he founded Roivant Sciences, an incredibly successful biotech company. He would later co-found Strive Asset Management, an investment firm that positions itself in opposition to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG).
In February of 2023, he announced his candidacy for the Republican Party's nomination for President in the 2024 election. Vivek has been a stark critic of the woke agenda and vows to dismantle the ever elusive deep state. This episode explores his upbringing and his ultimate goal of reestablishing a government for the people, by the people and of the people.

      <title>#70 Brandon Fugal - Owner of the Mysterious Skinwalker Ranch Reveals UAP/UFO Encounters </title>
      <description>Brandon Fugal is the owner and proprietor of Skinwalker Ranch. Initially, Brandon's intention was to dispel the rumors and mystique surrounding Skinwalker Ranch. However, a meeting with an Area 51 specialist on the property led to a series of unexplained and peculiar phenomena. This encounter profoundly impacted him and fueled his determination to pursue the truths concealed within the ranch.
During this episode, we learn about Brandon's upbringing, explore how he built a prosperous career in commercial real estate, and delve into his acquisition of the infamous Skinwalker Ranch from Aerospace billionaire, Robert Bigelow.
Brandon has allocated millions of dollars to support research endeavors at the ranch, unraveling anomalies along the way. True to his character, he has never personally profited from these exploits, opting instead to reinvest proceeds into the project and charitable causes.

      <title>#69 Don Graves - World War II Marine Survives Iwo Jima with Flamethrower, Grenades, and Pistol | SRS #69</title>
      <description>"Yesterday, December 7, 1941 a date which will live in infamy the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan....with confidence in our armed forces with the unbounding determination of our people we will gain the inevitable triumph so help us God." - Franklin D. Roosevelt
These were the words that would change the course of history forever. These words would also give way to the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the most costly campaigns of World War II. Of the 7,000 killed and nearly 20,000 wounded, Don Graves, a Marine would survive amongst them. Graves shouldered one of the most feared responsibilities in the Marine Corps–wielding a flamethrower in the caves and pill boxes that littered the island. In this episode, Graves recounts his experience in those 36 days of fighting and lends his perspective on where the country is headed now. Graves, now 98 years of age, has a wise view and a wealth of knowledge to share with the American people.

      <title>#68 Tyler Vargas-Andrews - Marine's Horrific Account of the Disastrous Afghanistan EVAC</title>
      <description>The United States withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan in August of 2021, signaling the end of a nearly 20 year conflict that cost 8 Trillion dollars and the lives of 900,000 people, including over 7,000 U.S. Service Members. The U.S. exit from Afghanistan resulted in the Taliban reestablishing armed control of the country and created a refugee crisis as over 1.5 Million Afghans fled. The withdrawal has been widely considered a disaster and a gross display of incompetent leadership from the President down, echoing similar failures seen at Saigon nearly half a century earlier.
SRS is honored to present the story and view point from one of the Marines on the ground in Kabul, just days before the last U.S. Embassy fell–Tyler Vargas-Andrews. On August 26th, Vargas-Andrews was gravely wounded by a suicide bombing at the gates of Kabul's Airport, ultimately losing two limbs as a result of his injuries. This premeditated attack killed 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. Service Members.

      <description>Last but certainly not least, Eric Hecker closes out our Whistleblower Marathon this week on SRS. Eric is former Navy and contractor for Raytheon, a major U.S. defense contractor. Eric's position as a firefighter and plumber for the South Pole facility gave him unrestricted access to the compound. During his stay, Eric observed highly advanced directed energy weapons and other technologies beyond what we previously thought possible. Eric has also testified to congress under oath and hopes to bring his experience to the public for the good of humanity.

      <title>#66 DC Long - Army Combat Vet's Mysterious UFO Encounter in Underground Military Base | Part 2</title>
      <description>The Whistleblower Marathon continues with former Army Combat Veteran DC Long. DC and his Father, then government contractors, were tasked with standing up a shoot house at Range 19. Before they knew it, they were ushered underground at gunpoint only to encounter a "Monolithic Slab."
Long shares his story in great detail, recounting the sights and sounds of this UAP / UFO. Long describes a series of events that unfolded post his encounter that would ultimately separate he and his Father for life. This episode is a cold, hard look at how sinister the aftermath of such an encounter can be.

      <title>#63 Shawn Ryan - The Guardian Angel Who Guided Me to Become a Warrior for God </title>

      <description>Episode #61 is a masterclass in self discovery and self worth. Tyler Grey is a former Army Ranger Sniper &amp; Delta Force Operator turned Actor and Director. You might know him from the hit CBS series "SEAL Team."

      <title>#60 David Tice - The Power Grid Blackout / America's WORST Enemy Could Attack Any Moment</title>
      <description>David Tice is a geopolitical strategist and producer / director of the eye opening documentary ‘Grid Down, Power Up.’ David came on to tell us about the unbelievable vulnerabilities of the U.S. power grid. Electricity–it's cheap, fast, and readily available across most of the world. We rely on electricity to survive, yet most of us take it for granted. While we've gotten comfortable, a disaster has been brewing with every light switch flipped. It's not a matter of "if" but "when" the grid will fail.
David reveals that not only has the United States invested very little in its power grid infrastructure since the 1950s, but power companies are actively lobbying to provide as little protection and updates to the grid as possible. We get into how adversaries like China &amp; Russia have openly plotted against the U.S. by way of implicating our grid and even how numerous homegrown attacks against vital electrical infrastructure has flown under the radar or at worst–purposefully ignored.
We're doing something special with this episode: giving YOU a way to get involved and make an impact. We're asking our audience to visit https://griddownpowerup.com/participate/ and take direct action to contact your legislators &amp; regulators. David and his crew have put this link together to make doing this as easy a few clicks. You have no excuse. Your life and the lives of those you love depend on it.

      <title>#56 Ryan Montgomery - #1 Ethical Hacker Who Hunts Child Predators Catches One Live On Podcast</title>
      <description>1 in 5 children in the United States will be sexually exploited online. Every 9 minutes, Child Protective Services finds evidence of child sexual abuse. 93% of victims know the perpetrator. These are horrifying and sobering statistics that drove the Shawn Ryan Show to expose this topic–this is where Ryan Montgomery comes in.
Ryan is the #1 "ethical hacker" in the world and it's a title he's earned by infiltrating websites that host child exploitation and exposing the predators that run rampant there. Ryan takes us into the underbelly of this dark-web hidden world and lights it up in real time. During the filming of this show, Ryan ran a mini-sting operation from his laptop in a chatroom, posing as a teen–it took less than 60 seconds for a predator to take the bait.
This episode is a cold, hard look at the pervasive problem that is child exploitation. Although it's difficult to stomach, we do believe that this episode will educate parents and save thousands of children. Ryan has dedicated his life to saving human life via his treatment center for those with addiction and by forcing this vile topic into the light. We are honored to share his message.

      <title>#55 Prime Hall - MARSOC Raider Survives The Unthinkable / Horrific Combat Experience | Part 2</title>
      <description>In part two of this episode, we get heavy into Prime's deployments. We learn about the unique bond US Operators have with their Afghan partners and how those bonds bend and break when the sum of all fears becomes a reality–an insider attack. This attack claimed multiple lives and would influence procedure and policy for the remainder of the war.
Prime shares in detail his experience transitioning from intense combat rotations into civilian life and the grueling realities of PTSD. His life was hanging by a thread until alternative treatments changed his world and set him on the path to training Olympians and launching Underwater Torpedo League into a globally acclaimed sport.

      <title>#55 Prime Hall - MARSOC Raider Shares His Darkest Memories / Traumatized to Transformation | Part 1</title>
      <description>Episode #55 is an unfiltered look at trauma and the long road to recovery. Prime Hall is a former Marine Raider with 12 years of service and is now a coach and consultant to some of the country's top companies and Olympic athletes. In part one of this two part series, Prime shares the burdens of his childhood that would haunt him well into his Military career. Hall puts the audience in the shoes of a young recruit with a troubled past and a growing rap sheet while also navigating the path to Special Operations.

      <title>#54 Yeonmi Park - Escaping the Horrors of North Korea &amp; the Kim Dynasty</title>
      <description>Yeonmi Park is an activist and author who fled to the United States after being a victim of sex trafficking. Park recounts her oppressive childhood in North Korea, starved and without electricity. She remembers how the lights of neighboring countries gave her hope for a better life. She spares no detail when explaining what a society under a ruthless dictator, mass killings, and delusional propaganda looks like.
Yeonmi takes us through her harrowing journey being smuggled out of North Korea only to meet a new terrifying reality - the Chinese sex trade. Park speaks frankly about the realities of survival in captivity and the pain she carries with her still today. We wrap up with her rescue by missionaries and her first brush with freedom in Times Square. Yeonmi illuminates some hard truths and warns of the signs of communism seeping into the United States.

      <title>#52 Andrew Bustamante - CIA Spy / U.S. vs China - The New Cold War | Part 2</title>
      <description>Andrew Bustamante is back in Part Two of this two-part series to discuss the "sleeping dragon," China. Bustamante tells us how a 5,000 year old country like China moves slowly and quietly with little known initiatives like the "Belt Way," and how he believes a move to take Taiwan is an imminent threat. 
We dive deep into the recent Spy Balloon phenomenon over US airspace and growing Chinese influence and capability across the globe through social media and shadow propaganda. We wrap up with a realistic look at the severity of different types of threats like EMPs and China's financial stakes on land and resource here at home.

      <title>#51 Chris VanSant - Delta Force Operator / Killing Off the "Deck of Cards" &amp; Capturing Saddam Hussein  | Part 2</title>
      <description>Delta Force Operator Chris VanSant is back in Part 2 of this two-part series. This episode dives deep into his role in the invasion of Iraq and the capture of Saddam Hussein. VanSant vividly recalls an engagement with over 300 enemy combatants after a goat herder revealed his team's location. We get a first hand account of the operational tempo it takes to hunt down each player of the infamous "Deck of Cards," and what happens when a handful of Delta Operators are outnumbered in the Horn of Africa with only the Navy Destroyer U.S.S. Chafee for cover.
VanSant tells stories of loss and grappling with the survivor's guilt that would ultimately change the course of his life. Chris serves on the board of the All Secure Foundation and is on a multi-year effort to complete the seven summits to raise awareness for veteran mental health and support All Secure.

      <title>#50 Chris / Kristin Beck - Navy SEAL Transitions To Woman Then Back To Man</title>
      <description>Episode #50 is one of the most important interviews you'll ever hear. Chris Beck is a retired Navy Seal with 20 years service &amp; 15 deployments under his belt. Even with his Bronze Star with Valor, Chris wasn't only known for his skills behind the trigger, but for his brilliance in technology and engineering.
Chris pioneered the mission planning systems for all of SOCOM, revolutionized the future of warfare with the "Iron Man" Project, and contracted for the Pentagon with a $600 million dollar research and development budget. Despite all of his accomplishments, Chris was facing demons in private. TBIs, PTSD, and a traumatic childhood sent Chris down a path to find out who he truly was. Through trauma and misguided agendas, Chris transitioned to a woman and after years of being pulled into this ideology, ultimately started the long journey to transitioning back into the man he always was.
This episode explores his journey through an abusive childhood, the trans agenda, and the nuance of sexuality &amp; biology. Chris's fiance' Courtney joins us and explains how gender dysphoria can endanger and influence children and how society has reached a breakpoint with these issues. Stick around until the end of the episode to learn how Chris sparing a life in combat may have set the stage for him to save his own and how thousands of others will be.

      <title>DECLASSIFIED #47 Dallas Alexander - The World's Farthest Sniper Kill / JTF2 Operator</title>

      <title>#49 Tim Parlatore - The Fight for Free Speech Against a Foreign Government</title>
      <description>In this special episode, we give you an update on the continued fight for free speech from the attorney working the case—Tim Parlatore. Parlatore explains how the events with our Dallas Alexander episode are unfolding and how the Canadian government is trying, but failing to censor a free American podcast.
We'll also explore how woke culture and foreign influence are weakening our institutions, from the military all the way to congress. Shawn &amp; Parlatore discuss how we got here, but more importantly - how we turn the tide.

      <title>#48 Dr. Steven Greer - Mystery Behind UFO / UAPs, Alien Phenomenon, and The Secret Government</title>
      <description>Steven M. Greer, MD, a retired emergency room Physician turned to a life of research of UFO/UAP Phenomenons,  is the Founder of The Disclosure Project, The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI), The Orion Project, Sirius Technology Advanced Research, LLC and is considered one of the world’s foremost authorities on all things UFO / UAP.
In this episode, Dr. Greer lays out exactly how nearly a century of information and discovery of Extraterrestrial life and technology have been hidden from the public and shrouded under a veil of dark money and secrecy. Greer explains the inner-workings of a global government that goes beyond the world's most elite intelligence agencies and infiltrated the circles of pop culture icons like Marilyn Monroe and JFK.

      <title>#46 Ioan Grillo - Cartel Wars &amp; The Fentanyl Crisis</title>
      <description>Cartels, drugs, money, corruption—author and award winning journalist Ioan Grillo has seen it all in his twenty-plus years' of covering Latin America. In this episode, we cover the unprecedented violence that broke out in the city of Culiacán after Mexican authorities recaptured Sinaloa cartel leader Ovidio Guzmán, son of "El Chapo."
Grillo breaks down the inner workings of Mexico's most notorious cartels, their recruitment strategies and growing turf wars. We cover the issues with the US / Mexico border and how fentanyl has revolutionized the drug business while wreaking havoc throughout the country. We'll discuss the question—Should cartels be designated as terrorist organizations? The answer isn't as simple as you might think.

      <title>#45 Bob "Ninja" Poras - Inside CIA's Global Response Staff | Part 2</title>
      <description>Ninja is back in the final installment of this two-part series. This episode spans his entire career working for the CIA, covering the differences between CIA staffers and GRS contractors, and how the enemy evolved their IED based warfare into a new kind of weapon: EFP.
Bob gives us a behind the scenes look at the Khost bombing and the triple agent behind it. Learn about an event in Tripoli that saved 150+ lives and lasted a grueling 24 hours - the greatest evacuation you've never heard about. We'll wrap up with his transition into civilian life and a high-speed motorcycle crash that changed everything.

      <title>#45 Bob "Ninja" Poras - CIA / Delta Force Operator | Part 1</title>
      <description>Bob "Ninja" Poras has us wondering where he got his call sign. He spent most of his career in the shadows. Some days "AWOL", but most of them fighting as the tip of the spear with 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment–Delta (1st SFOD-D), and eventually - working for the CIA as a GRS operator.  
He covers lessons in leadership and the perfect grenade toss while operating in Panama during 'Just Cause,' his first brush with the same Delta squadron that would later be his own. We later learn where the famous trope "this is my safety" originated from. We wrap up part one of this two-part series with Pablo Escobar, Bosnia ops with German GSG 9, and more.

He’s lived through it all at the highest level in his Navy SEAL career: From failures as a young leader that resulted in him almost being kicked out of the SEAL teams, to redemption and leading teams in intense combat operations in Iraq, to being shot eight times, including a round to the face, and nearly dying during an enemy ambush, Jason has lived the OVERCOME Mindset he now teaches others.

      <title>#26 Alex Epstein - The Global Energy War</title>
      <description>We are currently in the middle of a global energy war. Alex Epstein joins us to discuss what the implications of the current Green Initiative will be, how China ties in and stands to benefit in a world where the US now depends on them for energy, and how the benefits of fossil fuels have been completely ignored for years. 
Alex Epstein is a Fossil Fuel Philosopher, author, and industrial and energy policy commentator. He is the founder and president of the Center for Industrial Progress, a for-profit organization in San Diego, California.
Alex speaks with Shawn about his latest book “Fossil Future” and the negative impacts of the current energy war, our climate, and the unique benefits of fossil fuels to human flourishing—including their unrivaled ability to provide low-cost, reliable energy to billions of people around the world, especially the world’s poorest people.

      <title>#24 Shawn Ryan's Psychedelic Experience</title>
      <description>I am revealing every little detail of my psychedelic experience, all the intuitions, what I saw, what I felt, what I believe it all meant, and how the journey healed me in the end. I am opening up about my experience for two reasons. The first being because I believe this will help a great number of people, and the second is to raise money for VETS the organization that put me through the treatment so they can continue healing our US Special Operations Veterans.

      <title>#16 Chief Hallgrimson - Guilty of Assault After Rescuing Baby from Murderer</title>
      <description>Chief of Police Greenwood, MO Greg Hallgrimson contacted me over 2 years via email to let me know how much a video I made on social anxiety helped him. After reading his email and googling his name I found out what a hero this man is and invited him on the show. The email is linked below for everyone to read. Chief Hallgrimson saved a 6 month old baby girl from being murdered by her father and then was charged with assault. He has lost not only his position as Chief of Police but also his entire career, his retirement, and his identity. He is now seeking employment. If you would like to contact him, his email is linked below along with all of his awards and his support page. Please sign his petition.

      <title>#15 DJ Shipley SEAL - Team 6 / DEVGRU Operator</title>
      <description>This episode of The Shawn Ryan Show I sit down with former SEAL TEAM 6/DEVGRU Operator DJ Shipley. Shipley has 17 years serving the United States at the highest level as a Navy SEAL Tier 1 operator. Shipley gives us the most descriptive interview I have ever done. His service goes unmatched. Shipley is also the founder of GBRS Group, a tactical training group that only employs Tier 1 Operators and the founder of Tribe Sk8z a company that makes one of a kind skate boards that are works of art, and employs only Gold Star family members (The title, which is reserved for families of military members who have died in the line of duty). Enjoy the show.

      <title>#13 Bernie Kerik - September 11th 2001 NYC Police Commissioner</title>
      <description>9/11/2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the deadliest attack ever on American soil. September 11th 2001 not only changed our country here in the United States, but the events reshaped the entire world moving forward from that point on in many ways. 2977 people died in the attacks that day, 2606 alone died in The World Trade Center when the towers collapsed, many more firefighters, police officers, and first responders died in what became the greatest rescue mission of all time saving those left to survive in the attacks amongst the rubble. In this episode to mark 20 years I interview the man who led the entire operation in New York City on that day. I get the inside and exclusive story behind his entire decision making process, his unparalleled, heroic, and relentless leadership that would turn the most tragic attack to ever happen on United States soil into the greatest rescue mission of all time. Please welcome former NYC Police Commissioner Mr. Bernie Kerik to the Shawn Ryan Show.

      <title>#11 The Blackwater Massacre</title>
      <description>After thirteen years of political persecution and wrongful imprisonment, four U.S. veterans reunited last Christmas with their loyal families after receiving Presidential pardons that some described as “an affront to justice.” In their first joint interview on The Shawn Ryan Show, the four men of Blackwater USA’s Raven 23 Tactical Support Team sit down with Shawn Ryan to discuss the most controversial gunfight of the entire Iraq War, the complete system failure of the U.S. government, a corrupt court system, and incompetent journalists that demonized them as war criminals and convicted them before standing trial, despite their innocence. In an extensive interview, Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty, Nick Slatten and Paul Slough discuss their ordeal as well as their experience in battle, their time in prison, their faith, and reuniting with their families. Special appearances from Gina Keating and Eddie Gallagher

      <title>#9 Tu Lam Former - Green Beret / Call of Duty / CEO Rōnin Tactics</title>
      <description>Retired Green Beret Tu Lam, CEO of Rōnin Tactics and Call of Duty Character has a conversation with Shawn Ryan to discuss how he was smuggled out of Vietnam, his 23 year military career (20 of which as a Green Beret), his dark transition into civilian life living with PTSD from a long career of war fighting in Special Operations, Lam opened up about his childhood, how he overcame Asian racism at a young age, his military career and success in the entertainment industry. He recounts a visit to the principal's office when he was in third grade where he was belittled by the mother of his bully and the administration did nothing. "She told me that my kind don't belong here and that I need to go back home to my country," said Tu Lam. "I made a promise to myself that day that I was stronger than hate." Lam fulfilled his promise, joined the Army and became a Green Beret. He served in the military for 23 years, 20 of those years in special operations. After retiring from the service he founded Ronin Tactics, became the inspiration behind Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's Daniel "Ronin" Shinoda and Co-Host of Forged In Fire: Knife or Death on History Channel.

      <title>#8 Eddie Gallagher - Retired Navy SEAL Tried for Murder</title>
      <description>Chief Special Operator Eddie Gallagher is without a doubt the most controversial Navy SEALs of modern day history, and quite possibly in the entire history of Naval Special Warfare. Shawn Ryan Show #008 Chief Gallagher explains in depth how teammates under his command at SEAL Team 7 not only accused him of being a war criminal, but relentlessly tried to send him away to life in prison for the alleged murder of an ISIS fighter in Mosul, Iraq. Eddie walks us through his version on what seemed to be the entire Naval Special Warfare community continuously attempting to take his rank, strip him of his SEAL Trident, and ravage his reputation even after proven innocent. His wife Andrea and son Ryan share their first hand accounts of how the NCIS raided their home and strategically wreaked havoc on their family.

      <title>#5 Mike Ritland - Navy SEAL Warrior K9 Dog Trainer (Part 2)</title>
      <description>In part 2 of Vigilance Elite's "Shawn Ryan Show" #005 with Mike Ritland we discuss some of his methods as a top tier K9 dog trainer working with military, police, and many other government agencies. We go into great detail about the psychology and mindset of the warrior dogs and the toll that a deployment full of combat has on the dogs as they return home from war. Mike opens up about his non-profit "The Warrior Dog Foundation" which rehabilitates and gives dogs coming back from war a home they can be comfortable in.

      <title>#3 Don Bradley - A.K.A. Headshot Don</title>
      <description>In this episode Shawn Ryan sits down with Don Bradley A.K.A. Head Shot Don who is a former Green Beret and a former CIA Contractor who has over 20 combat deployments with the CIA alone. Don has a severe TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) and his symptoms can hit unexpectedly so we go right into the meat of this one with absolutely 0 fluff. He is an operator who has seen more combat than most can imagine but consistently displayed the upmost self restraint while under attack and extreme duress which is extremely hard to do. We go into detail into 3 separate incidences one of which actually happens right here in The United States in Monroe County, Georgia where his destiny unfortunately falls in the hands of the court system.
