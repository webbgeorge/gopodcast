    <title>The Ezra Klein Show</title>
    <description>Each Tuesday and Friday, Ezra Klein invites you into a conversation on something that matters. How do we address climate change if the political system fails to act? Has the logic of markets infiltrated too many aspects of our lives? What is the future of the Republican Party? What do psychedelics teach us about consciousness? What does sci-fi understand about our present that we miss? Can our food system be just to humans and animals alike?

      <itunes:title>Let’s Get to the Marrow of What Trump Just Did</itunes:title>
      <itunes:author>New York Times Opinion</itunes:author>
      <itunes:duration>01:03:23</itunes:duration>
      <itunes:summary>On the first day of President Trump’s second term, he signed a record 26 executive orders. Some of them were really big. Others feel more likely messaging memos. And still others are bound to be held up in the courts. So what does it all amount to? What exactly in America has changed?

In a former life, I co-hosted a podcast called “The Weeds” with other policy wonks at Vox, including Dara Lind and Matthew Yglesias. We’ve since gone our separate ways; Lind is currently a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, and Yglesias is the author of the Substack newsletter Slow Boring. But since this was such a big policy week, I wanted to get some of the band back together.

In this conversation, we discuss how much Trump’s immigration orders will actually change our immigration system; whether any of Trump’s orders address Americans’ concerns over prices; how serious Trump actually is about tariffs; and more.

Book Recommendations:

The Fifth Risk by Michael Lewis

Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver

Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here by Jonathan Blitzer

Left Adrift by Timothy Shenk

Why Nothing Works by Marc J. Dunkelman

Middlemarch by George Eliot
