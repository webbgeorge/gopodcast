      <title>Why 90% of Alzheimer's cases are preventable | Drs. Ayesha and Dean Sherzai</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Dementia is one of the fastest-growing health crises in the developed world, with cases expected to double in the coming decades. But despite common misconceptions, cognitive decline isn’t inevitable. The latest research shows that lifestyle choices play a far greater role in brain health than genetics alone.
In this episode, neurologists Drs. Ayesha and Dean Sherzai share practical, science-backed strategies to help you protect your brain and reduce your risk of dementia. 
As co-directors of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University, they’ve spent their careers studying how habits like diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management influence long-term cognitive health.

      <title>Recap: Maintain brain health as you age | Dr. William Li</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Today, we’re putting the spotlight on our brains.
As we age certain behaviours often become more noticeable - misplacing keys, struggling to recall names or forgetting why you walked into a room. Most of us have likely seen this happen to someone close to us and may have even seen these patterns develop into more serious conditions like dementia.
But are these behaviours just an inevitable part of getting older? Or is there something we can do to prevent them?
Dr William Li is here to outline the connection between our lifestyle and the health of our brain.

      <title>Could fasting extend your lifespan? | Dr. Valter Longo and Prof. Tim Spector</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>How old are you? A better question might be: how old do you feel? While your birthday says one thing, your biological age—the health of your cells—might tell a very different story. And here’s the best part: unlike your chronological age, your biological age can go down.
But how? For years, fasting has been celebrated as a key to longevity. Yet the challenge of skipping meals is enough to make most of us shy away. What if you could trick your body into reaping the rewards of fasting—without starving yourself? 
This week, we’re joined by Dr. Valter Longo, Director of the Longevity Institute at USC and one of TIME’s 50 most influential people in healthcare. Valter’s groundbreaking research on ageing and his FMD program have transformed how we think about health and longevity. Joining him is Tim Spector, ZOE’s co-founder and one of the world’s top 100 most-cited scientists.

      <title>Recap: What is inflammation and how can I control it | Prof. Philip Calder</title>
      <description>Today we’re discussing inflammation.
We hear this word a lot from guests on the ZOE podcast. It’s always coming up when we ask questions about health conditions like Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease. 
It’s clearly very important, however many of us still don’t fully understand what inflammation really is.
Professor Phillip Calder is here to break down inflammation and share tips on what we should eat to keep it in check. Philip is Head of the School of Human Development and Health in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton.

      <title>The science of weight loss – and why calories don’t count! | Prof. Giles Yeo</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Think weight loss is all about eating less and moving more? Think again. In this episode, Prof. Giles Yeo reveals why calorie counting isn’t just inaccurate—it could actually make weight management harder. He explains why the popular “calories in, calories out” method doesn’t add up and explores how factors like genetics, brain signals, and gut health play a major role in shaping our weight.
Giles Yeo is a Professor of Molecular Neuroendocrinology at the University of Cambridge and Honorary President of the British Dietetic Association. His research focuses on the influence of genes on feeding behaviour and body weight. Giles is also the author of ‘Gene Eating’ and ‘Why Calories Don’t Count’.
Giles shares the surprising impact of ultra-processed foods on how we process calories and why losing weight often feels like a battle against our own biology. With decades of research in his back pocket, Giles shares science-backed advice to help you break free from yo-yo dieting, read calorie labels smarter, and embrace a more balanced, plant-rich diet for long-term health.

      <title>Is your gut microbiome preventing weight loss? | Dr. Suzanne Devkota and Prof. Tim Spector</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Belly fat is more than just stubborn weight – it plays a complex role in our health, interacting with the immune system and gut bacteria. But could gut microbes hold the key to understanding and managing belly fat?
In this episode, Dr. Suzanne Devkota, Director of the Microbiome Research Institute at Cedars-Sinai, shares groundbreaking findings on how gut bacteria interact with belly fat. Tim Spector, professor of epidemiology and scientific co-founder at ZOE, also joins the conversation to explain how the diversity of your gut bacteria affects weight and overall health.

      <title>ZOE's best health tips of 2024 - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Let’s take a look back at our best episodes of 2024. We had an incredible lineup of guests this year who shared a huge range of actionable tips on improving your nutrition and gut health. 
A lot of what we learned might surprise you. Like the beverage you’re probably drinking every day that we thought was bad for us? Turns out it can actually be super beneficial. Or that what counts as a plant is actually so much more than just fruit and veg. Not forgetting the topic we’ve shattered the taboo on - which made our celebrity guest emotional. 
You’ll finish this episode equipped to tackle your post-Christmas slump and feel energised to build new habits with ZOE in 2025.

      <title>Are artificial sweeteners harming your gut? | Dr. Eran Elinav and Prof. Tim Spector</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Artificial sweeteners are everywhere. They hide in cereal, salad dressing – even in health foods. But are they really a guilt-free way to satisfy your sweet tooth? Or is it naive to think that – because they’re zero calorie – they’re free of consequence?
New research shows there is a consequence. And it could be massive. Artificial sweeteners may disrupt the delicate balance of bacteria that live in your gut. You could see ripple effects like chronic disease, weight gain and a weakened ability to process real sugar.
Today’s guest is at the forefront of this research. For the last decade, Dr Eran Elinav led breakthroughs on the science behind popular sweeteners. He leads The Institute for Microbiome Research at the Weizmann Institute of Science. He’s published over 100 publications in leading scientific journals. And his lab is on the cutting-edge of gut microbiome research. 
We’re also joined today by Tim Spector. Tim is one of the world’s top 100 most-cited scientists, a professor of epidemiology, and my scientific Co-Founder at ZOE. 
You’ll finish today’s episode knowing what's in your sweetener, how it’s affecting you, and where to turn to satisfy your sweet tooth.

      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Most women will recognize one or two symptoms of menopause - the infamous hot flashes or weight gain. But there’s also brittle nails, tingling in your hands and changes to your taste buds. In fact, there are more than 50 symptoms of menopause. 
Today’s guest, Tamsen Fadal, found out she was in menopause while on live TV. Tamsen is an Emmy award winning journalist and executive producer of the documentary “The M Factor: Shredding the Silence on Menopause”. She’s got a new book titled “How to Menopause”.
Tamsen is joined by Dr. Sarah Berry. Sarah runs the world’s largest study on nutrition and menopause here at ZOE. She developed a free tool called the MenoScale calculator that helps you track your symptoms so you can find relief. Sarah is a world leader in large-scale human nutritional studies, associate professor in nutrition at King’s College London and Chief Scientist at ZOE.

      <title>The truth about expiry dates, freezing food and vegetable scraps | Carleigh Bodrug and Dr. Will Bulsiewicz</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>We waste a shocking 40% of the food we buy. We throw away foods like carrot tops, beet greens, and spent coffee grounds. These ‘food scraps’ stuff our landfills and drain our pockets. But we can eat these foods and many of them offer tons of healthy nutrients.
Today’s guest is Carleigh Bodrug. Carleigh’s published a best-selling cookbook with over 140 recipes made from food scraps you might otherwise throw away. Her mission is simple: eat more plants. Her online community, PlantYou, has more than 10 million followers.
She’s joined by Dr. Will Bulsiewicz. Will is a board-certified gastroenterologist and ZOE’s U.S. Medical Director. He reveals the hidden nutritional value of these food scraps, and how ‘scrappy cooking’ can get you eating that all-important 30 plants per week.
You’ll walk away from today’s episode saving your money and the planet, all while eating more plants.

        <![CDATA[<p>We waste a shocking 40% of the food we buy. We throw away foods like carrot tops, beet greens, and spent coffee grounds. These ‘food scraps’ stuff our landfills and drain our pockets. But we can eat these foods and many of them offer tons of healthy nutrients.</p><p>Today’s guest is Carleigh Bodrug. Carleigh’s published a best-selling cookbook with over 140 recipes made from food scraps you might otherwise throw away. Her mission is simple: eat more plants. Her online community, PlantYou, has more than 10 million followers.</p><p>She’s joined by Dr. Will Bulsiewicz. Will is a board-certified gastroenterologist and ZOE’s U.S. Medical Director. He reveals the hidden nutritional value of these food scraps, and how ‘scrappy cooking’ can get you eating that all-important 30 plants per week.</p><p>You’ll walk away from today’s episode saving your money and the planet, all while eating more plants.</p><p><br></p><p>🥑 Make smarter food choices.

      <title>5 years after COVID, what did we learn? | Dr. Tim Spector</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>The COVID-19 pandemic is in the rear-view mirror, so what did we learn about mask wearing, vaccines and prevention? And how can you stay healthy to face a future pandemic? 
Professor Tim Spector, one of the world’s top 100 most cited scientists, looks back on the pandemic and what we learnt about symptoms, transmission and vaccines in the early stages. We’ll reflect on ZOE’s role - collecting data from millions of people on their symptoms, identifying COVID hotspots and shaping public understanding of the virus.
Then we discuss the possibility of the next pandemic, and how we can individually protect ourselves against it. By the end of this episode, listeners feel more equipped to stay safe in the face of another global pandemic.

      <title>8 foods that soothe anxiety | Dr. Uma Naidoo </title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>1 in 3 people have anxiety. It’s the most common mental health disorder in the world. And many of us know what anxiety feels like: palms sweating before a job interview, losing your appetite before a looming deadline, a pit in your stomach when you get bad news. It’s not just in your head, it’s in your gut.
Today, we’ll learn how food could help us cope. Our guest explains the rising global trend toward increased anxiety: its rise through the pandemic, and explosion among young people. 
Dr. Uma Naidoo is on the forefront of nutritional psychiatry. She directs the first hospital-based Nutritional Psychiatry Service in the US, at Massachusetts General Hospital and teaches at Harvard Medical School.
Uma will help you understand the symptoms and biology of anxiety, painting a picture of the risks it poses for long-term health. And her diet tips will help you fuel your gut for a healthy mind.

      <link>http://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Today we’re discussing how the food we eat can lower cholesterol.
It’s an important question, as high cholesterol can increase our chances of developing heart disease. Around half of adults have high cholesterol, and it gets more common as you age.
So, how can we break this trend?
Today’s guest, Professor Sarah Berry has led more than 30 human studies on cardio-metabolic health. It’s safe to say she knows a thing or two about heart health and cholesterol.

      <title>Eat your way to better gynecological health | Dr. Jennifer Ashton &amp; Prof. Sarah Berry</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>A good gynecologist is like a detective. She gathers evidence to diagnose infections. She uncovers the truth behind stages like puberty, pregnancy and perimenopause. Yet many women still feel that their physiology is a mystery. 
What if a clue to that mystery hides in our diet? Similar to the gut, certain foods make the vaginal microbiome thrive. New research suggests that the right diet could alleviate symptoms of the most common gynecological diseases. 
Dr Jennifer Ashton is former Chief Medical Correspondent at ABC News and is a double-board certified OBGYN. She joins us today to discuss ‘nutritional gynecology’, a term she coined after realizing multiple women’s health issues have a direct relationship to nutrition. 
Alongside Jen is King’s College London professor and ZOE’s Chief Scientist Sarah Berry. Sarah shines light on the growing evidence of the role of nutrition in offsetting uncomfortable, and sometimes dangerous, symptoms of menopause.

      <title>Recap: How much protein do you need? | Prof. Christopher Gardner</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Did you know you can now buy ice cream with added protein? Even breakfast cereals are jumping on the trend, boasting an extra protein punch.
In nearly every supermarket aisle, you'll spot the catchy slogan "high in protein" plastered across packaging.
But why is that? Are we not getting enough protein already, or are these high-protein products giving us too much?
Our guest is Christopher Gardner, a professor at Stanford University and a member of ZOE’s scientific advisory board, who has published widely on the relationship between protein and our health.

      <title>4 immunity tips for healthy ageing | Dr. Jenna Macciochi</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com/</link>
      <description>Over the last two years, there’s been a rise in “immune-boosting” foods, supplements and trends. Today's guest, immunologist Dr. Jenna Macciochi, believes the immune system doesn’t need boosting. Instead, it should be balanced.
In this episode, Jenna - a Senior Lecturer in Immunology at the University of Sussex - reveals how your immune system is your body’s housekeeper. Jenna highlights the case for the ‘good bugs’ in our gut microbiome, the role of micronutrients and how our immune system isn’t born, but made.
We'll also tackle the age-old question: do we really need Vitamin C supplements?

      <title>Kids and junk food: simple ways to break the habit with Rhiannon Lambert &amp; Dr. Federica Amati</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>As adults, food shopping can be a minefield. But when it comes to feeding your kids, the stakes are even higher. Our food environment is rife with misinformation. Brightly coloured labels on packaged, often ultra-processed foods promise high protein, high fibre and low calories. The additives, emulsifiers and mountains of added sugar are hidden in the small print. 
So how can parents navigate this confusing landscape? Today, we hear from two of the UK’s most-trusted nutritionists (and both parents of small children) on how to keep your kids eating well. 
Rhiannon Lambert has authored four books, including recent Sunday Times bestseller The Science of Plant-Based Nutrition. Half a million people follow her for nutrition advice on Instagram. ZOE’s Head Nutritionist, Imperial College London lecturer and bestselling author of Every Body Should Know This, Dr. Federica Amati, joins Rhiannon for today’s conversation.

Whilst every woman will go through menopause, these highly personal questions are hard to confront. Questions like: Does lack of sleep lead to problematic weight gain? And why does intimacy feel so hard to rekindle?
In this episode, Dr. Kameelah Phillips joins us to bring clarity and compassion to these sensitive questions. She debunks the biggest myths around sleep, intimacy and emotional wellbeing in menopause. Her energy and positivity will empower you to thrive in this stage of life.

      <title>The truth about protein shakes, according to science | Dr Federica Amati</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Protein-rich diets have been popular for some time. Everything from chocolate bars to ice cream promises to be ‘high protein’. Influencers and media outlets seem to rave about the weight loss and muscle building potential of eating a lot of protein.
But when it’s added as an extra ingredient - sometimes with emulsifiers and sugar - is it really helping our muscles grow?
Today, ZOE's Head Nutritionist Dr. Federica Amati reveals the truth about protein bars and shakes, cutting through the marketing noise to find out how useful these products really are.

      <title>Simple ways to improve gut health | Dr. Karan Rajan</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Your body has two brains. And your second brain is your gut. Many think the “gut” is only the stomach - but it’s a network of organs, working together to regulate many different areas of health. When almost half of us suffer with gastrointestinal issues, learning how these organs interact is vital to improving symptoms.
On this episode, we’re joined by Dr Karan Rajan. When Karan’s not teaching his 10 million social media followers about common medical myths, he’s an NHS surgeon, operating on people’s bowels. Karan will reveal how our GI issues impact way more than just our poo.
Today, we explore how the gut and brain are connected, the lifestyle factors causing gut health issues and why it’s so hard for doctors to understand IBS.

      <title>Which chocolate is the healthiest? | Spencer Hyman and Prof. Sarah Berry</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Humans have been in love with chocolate for thousands of years. But not all chocolate is created equal, both in terms of health and taste. In this episode, chocolate expert Spencer Hyman and Professor Sarah Berry will take us on a trip into cacao. They’ll teach us what distinguishes good chocolate from bad chocolate and how we can beat our impulse to binge. 
Spencer breaks down how to produce craft chocolate. In six steps he will show us how we get from bean to bar. Sarah shares research into the health benefits of chocolate with a focus on fibre, flavanols and theobromine. They will also look at the controversy around the association between chocolate and heart health.

      <title>Davina McCall: Make this choice every day to reduce menopause symptoms</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com</link>
      <description>Half of the world’s population will go through menopause. Yet research shows that a large proportion of women do not feel informed and equipped for menopause. In this episode, we reveal the results of a brand new study that highlight the impact of diet on menopause symptoms.
Davina McCall is a British household name and much-loved TV presenter on a mission to change this. Her 2022 book Menopausing provided a roadmap for women to be fearless in tackling this stage of life. She has her own very personal menopause story and today, she shares it with us.

      <title>How to eat 30 plants this week | Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Prof. Tim Spector</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Thirty plants this week, think you could do it? It might sound a lot, but it’s easier than you think. Fruit, veg, nuts, seeds, even coffee all count as plants.
Legendary chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall joins us to share tips on eating more plants. Hugh’s new book ‘How to Eat 30 Plants a Week’ explores the wild world of legumes, grains, herbs and beyond. He explains that getting your thirty plants each week can be simple, fun and delicious.
Joining Hugh is Tim Spector - professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London and ZOE’s scientific co-founder. Tim explains why our gut microbiome loves plants, highlighting the importance of polyphenols, healthy fats and fiber.
You’ll finish this episode inspired, empowered and likely... hungry.

      <title>Blood sugar hacks to give you more energy | Glucose Goddess Jessie Inchauspé and Prof. Tim Spector</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Why do some people feel fine eating lots of carbs when others feel energy slumps? Is blood sugar to blame?
In this episode, we learn why blood sugar varies so much between people, and the tools to manage these levels. 
Tim Spector and Jessie Inchauspé (aka the Glucose Goddess) will discuss the latest science around glucose control, what the cool new device on the block – the CGM – can tell us and why blood sugar levels are only one part of the picture of our health.
Jessie is a bestselling author and science communicator with a community of over 5 million followers. Tim is a professor of epidemiology at King’s College London and ZOE’s scientific co-founder.

      <title>Why one in ten children have a food allergy | Dr. Gideon Lack</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Allergies are on the rise in both infants and adults. Many are calling it an epidemic. Allergies can limit your diet, cause irritation, and in some cases be life threatening. 
In today’s episode, we discuss the evidence suggesting that our gut plays a key role in protecting us from food allergies.
Professor Gideon Lack tells us how we can reduce the risk of allergies developing in children. Gideon also shares innovative ways to treat allergies and significantly reduce the risk of death. 
Gideon is Professor of Paediatric Allergy at King’s College London. His groundbreaking studies into allergies have reversed the official medical advice of multiple countries.

      <title>Recap: What Prof. Tim Spector got wrong about Mushrooms and UPFs</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>While researching for his bestselling book, Food for Life, Tim dug deep into the new science around UPFs. We used to think they were unhealthy because of their high salt, fat and sugar levels. But there’s much more to the story. 
Tim helps us navigate our UPF-filled grocery stores to eat healthier, and explains what he got wrong about a food group he'd previously overlooked... the humble mushroom.

      <title>Can NASA research help fight cancer? | Dr Jessica Scott</title>
      <link>https://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>What do astronauts and cancer patients have in common? 
Jonathan explores this fascinating connection with Dr. Jessica Scott, learning how six decades of NASA research is being used to help the recovery of cancer survivors. New research challenges the traditional notion that you should rest during cancer treatment. Instead, Jessica’s studies into exercise could hold the key to a long and healthy life post-diagnosis. 
Dr Jessica Scott started her career at NASA where she spent 7 years designing exercise programs for astronauts in outer space. Now, as the principal investigator at the world-leading Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, she is using her unique skillset in the fight against cancer.

      <title>Fix your body clock to improve long term health with Prof. Satchin Panda</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Our modern lifestyles mean that most of us don’t live our lives in sync with our circadian rhythms, which puts our health and well-being at risk. Eating and sleeping at the right time are important tools to help us align our circadian rhythms and reduce our risk of chronic disease. 
In this episode, circadian rhythm expert Prof. Satchin Panda will tell us how light and food act as master regulators of our body clock, how aligning our lifestyles with our body clock can improve our health, mood and energy levels and how to do this in practice. 
Satchin is a world-leading expert in the field of circadian rhythm research. He’s associate professor at the prestigious SALK institute, he’s recipient of the Dana Foundation Award in brain and immune system imaging and he’s also the author of two best-selling books, The Circadian Code and The Circadian Diabetes Code.

Eating and sleeping at the right time are important tools to help us align our circadian rhythms and reduce our risk of chronic disease. 
In this episode, circadian rhythm expert Prof. Satchin Panda will tell us how light and food act as master regulators of our body clock, how aligning our lifestyles with our body clock can improve our health, mood and energy levels and how to do this in practice. 
Satchin is a world-leading expert in the field of circadian rhythm research. He’s associate professor at the prestigious SALK institute, he’s recipient of the Dana Foundation Award in brain and immune system imaging and he’s also the author of two best-selling books, The Circadian Code and The Circadian Diabetes Code.

      <title>Remembering Michael Mosley: 4 habits that changed his life</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>After the tragic news of Michael Mosley's passing, we are re-releasing our episode with him, originally released in March 2023:
If you had to do just one thing to improve your health, what would it be?
Our busy lives mean it can be difficult to keep up healthy habits, and with so much conflicting advice out there it’s tricky to separate fact from fiction. In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by medical doctor, journalist, and presenter Michael Mosley, who is alongside ZOE regular Tim Spector, to discuss Michael’s four key habits to improve our health. 
Michael’s latest book ‘Just One Thing’ explores these habits and has seen him speak to singing scientists and eccentric iceman to healthy habit experts and evangelists. And of course, being Michael, he tried every habit out himself. We talk about which methods are the most effective, which he has incorporated into his life, and how he makes his new habits stick.

      <title>Is plant-based meat healthy? What the research shows with Prof. Christopher Gardner</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Meat consumption continues to be high in both the US and the UK. Yet many governments advise reducing meat consumption, particularly red meat, due to both environmental and health concerns. 
In this episode, we delve into the sizzling world of meat alternatives. They promise sustainability, animal welfare, and better health. Buzzwords like "plant-based" and "meat-free" proudly adorn their packaging. But are they actually healthy? Or should we consider them as ultra-processed foods and avoid them?
Christopher Gardner is a Professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of the Stanford Prevention Research Centre, and a world-leading expert in how the food that we eat impacts our health.

      <link>http://zoe.com/</link>
      <description>Periods are taboo! Despite the fact that half of the world’s population experience them. This taboo has led to countless myths around the topic. “The internet’s gynecologist” Dr. Jen Gunter is here to usher in a new era where people understand – and can advocate for – what they need as their body changes each cycle.
Jonathan is joined by Dr Sarah Berry and Dr Jen Gunter to get a better understanding of our body's behavior during the menstrual cycle. Jen will provide you with her period toolkit and offer solutions to the most common problems of modern-day period health.
Dr. Jen Gunter is a gynecologist and pain medicine physician at the Permanente Medical Group in northern California. Her books ‘The Vagina Bible’ and ‘The Menopause Manifesto’ were both New York Times bestsellers. Her 2024 book ‘Blood’ tackles the science, medicine and mythology of menstruation.

      <title>How inflammation could age you with Prof. Philip Calder</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Inflammation is a complicated topic. Short-term inflammation plays an essential role in fighting infections and healing injuries. But too much inflammation can be a catalyst for chronic ailments, like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and obesity.
What we eat can influence our inflammatory responses and contribute to chronic, low-grade inflammation.
In today’s episode, Prof. Philip Calder helps us understand the science behind inflammation, how it impacts our health and what food has to do with it.
Philip is head of the School of Human Development and Health, as well as a Professor of Nutritional Immunology, in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Southampton. He’s also an internationally recognised researcher on the metabolism and functionality of fatty acids. His work focuses on the roles of omega-3 fatty acids and the influence of diet and nutrients on immune and inflammatory responses.

Every 12 years, our skeletons undergo a complete transformation.
Prof. Tim Spector and Prof. Cyrus Cooper discuss how to avoid Osteoporosis, a condition where bones become fragile, significantly increases the risk of fractures from minor incidents, often without any noticeable symptoms. Worldwide, it affects one in three women and one in five men over fifty, leading to pain, potential disability and loss of independence.
In today’s episode, Jonathan, Tim and Cyrus ask the question: How can understanding osteoporosis and implementing targeted lifestyle changes enhance bone health and reduce the risk of fractures?
Cyrus Cooper is a Professor of Rheumatology at the University of Southampton, where he is also the Director of the MRC Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit and Vice-Dean of Medicine. In addition, he’s a Professor of Musculoskeletal Science at the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences at the University of Oxford.
Tim Spector is one of the world’s top 100 most-cited scientists, a professor of epidemiology, and scientific Co-Founder at ZOE. Tim trained originally in rheumatology and epidemiology.

      <title>The best exercise routine, according to your muscle clocks with Professor Karyn Esser</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Our bodies naturally follow a roughly 24-hour cycle, called our circadian rhythm. And every cell has a rhythm.
As we get older, we tend to lose muscle, making us more prone to falls and less able to live independently. Though we can't stop aging, staying active helps keep our muscles strong and our bodies healthy for longer.
Prof. Karyn Esser is a specialist in how the body's natural rhythms affect muscles. Today, she guides us through the latest research and shows that it's always possible to harness the power of your muscles to enhance your quality of life. She is a professor in the Department of Physiology and Aging at the University of Florida, where she’s also the co-director of the University of Florida Older Americans Independence Center.
In today's episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Karyn explore the body's internal clocks and ask: why do our muscles have their own schedule, and is there an ideal time of day to exercise?

      <title>Three ways to prevent diabetes with Professor Naveed Sattar</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>In today’s episode, we’re talking about a disease so widespread that it touches nearly every family in some way: type 2 diabetes. It’s not just a health issue, it's a rapidly expanding crisis. And many people don’t know that they have it. 
In the U.S. alone, 100 million people have prediabetes, and more than 37 million have type 2 diabetes, a chronic condition with life-altering effects.
Prof. Naveed Sattar joins us to shed light on preventing, treating, and potentially reversing type 2 diabetes. 
Naveed is a medical doctor and Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the Institute of Cardiovascular &amp; Medical Sciences at the University of Glasgow. He’s one of the world’s top 1% most cited clinical scientists, and he’s worked on many clinical trials of lifestyle changes and drugs to prevent and manage diabetes.

      <title>The surprising truth about histamine intolerance</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>We've probably all heard of “antihistamines,” medications that can ease symptoms of hay fever and other allergies. 
But what is “histamine”? It’s a vital chemical that our bodies produce, and it plays a role in a number of functions that support our health. 
Histamine intolerance seems to be increasingly common, but it’s difficult to diagnose. Some people may not be aware that they have it or how to treat it.
In today’s episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan speaks with Dr. Will Bulsiewicz, ZOE’s U.S. medical director, to learn more about this flourishing area of research — and the best ways to identify and treat histamine intolerance.
Will is a board-certified gastroenterologist, and New York Times bestselling author of the microbiome book Fiber Fueled.

      <itunes:summary>Stress is a main factor contributing to ill health, and Dr. Rangan Chatterjee believes that it’s the number-one cause of the illnesses he treats.
In today's episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Rangan sheds light on the causes of stress, ranging from sleep deprivation and overwhelming workloads to a lack of quality time with others.
You’ll learn how “microdoses” of stress can reach a tipping point, why recognizing these doses is key, and which powerful strategies can help you cope.
Are you ready to transform your relationship to stress?
Dr. Rangan Chatterjee is regarded as one of the most influential medical doctors in the U.K. He wants to change how medicine is practiced for years to come, and his mission is to help 100 million people around the globe live better lives. He’s a professor of health communication and education at the University of Chester, and he hosts one of the most listened-to health podcasts in the U.K. and Europe — Feel Better, Live More has had over 200 million listens to date and is listened to and watched by over 8 million people every month.

      <title>Mushrooms as medicine: Uncovering the health secrets of fungi</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>They’re not a plant or an animal — fungi are their very own kingdom of life. And their unique composition means they offer novel, often unbelievable, benefits to our health. Certain species of fungi are currently used to treat conditions ranging from cancer to depression. 
The love of mushrooms (or mycophilia) has grown in recent years. And at the heart of this movement is biologist Dr. Merlin Sheldrake, author of the bestseller Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures. 
In today’s episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan, Merlin, and ZOE Co-Founder Prof. Tim Spector ask: Why are mushrooms so special?

      <title>The truth about the Mediterranean diet</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Each day this week, we examine one of the world’s most popular diets. Putting the latest scientific evidence under the microscope, we’ll discover these diets' true impact on your health.
Today, we’re talking about the Mediterranean diet. This indulgent diet champions vegetables, beans, fish, and even red wine, all with a liberal helping of extra virgin olive oil.
However, this relatively high-fat diet undergoes many regional adaptations, and the wide range of options can be confusing, even intimidating, if you’re not that confident in the kitchen.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, Professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they discuss this diet's potential health benefits and pitfalls.

      <itunes:summary>Each day this week, we examine one of the world’s most popular diets. Putting the latest scientific evidence under the microscope, we’ll discover these diets' true impact on your health.
Today, we’re talking about the Mediterranean diet. This indulgent diet champions vegetables, beans, fish, and even red wine, all with a liberal helping of extra virgin olive oil.
However, this relatively high-fat diet undergoes many regional adaptations, and the wide range of options can be confusing, even intimidating, if you’re not that confident in the kitchen.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, Professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they discuss this diet's potential health benefits and pitfalls.

      <title>Does calorie counting improve your health?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Each day this week, we’re examining one of the world’s most popular diets. Putting the latest scientific evidence under the microscope, we’ll find out these diets' true impact on your health.
Today, we’re talking about the century-old paradigm of weight management — calorie counting. Rooted in the law of thermodynamics, the notion is simple: Consuming fewer calories than expended results in weight loss.
While seemingly straightforward, the practical application of calorie counting can prove challenging, with many of us underestimating our calorie intake or finding it difficult to maintain this diet long-term.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, Professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they explore this diet's complexities, addressing its potential and pitfalls.

      <title>The carnivore diet exposed: Healthful or harmful?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Each day this week, we’re examining one of the world’s most popular diets. Putting the latest scientific evidence under the microscope, we’ll find out the true impact of these diets on your health.
Today, we’re talking about the carnivore diet, a zero-carb approach centered on meat, fish, eggs, and minimal dairy while excluding all plant foods and alcohol.
Advocates claim it can help with autoimmune conditions, type 2 diabetes, and weight loss, asserting that our ancestors thrived eating this way. However, there are questions about nutrient deficiencies and excessive saturated fat intake with this diet.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, Professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they explore its purported advantages and drawbacks.

      <title>Does the paleo diet hold the secret to health?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Each day this week, we’re examining one of the world’s most popular diets. Putting the latest scientific evidence under the microscope, we’ll find out the true impact of these diets on your health.
Today, we’re talking about the paleo diet, rooted in the idea of emulating our hunter-gatherer ancestors after concerns about the impact of a modern westernized diet packed with highly processed foods.
However, the diet often involves consuming increased amounts of saturated fats, primarily from meat. This is associated with heightened cholesterol levels and heart disease risk.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, Professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they dissect the diet’s potential benefits, pitfalls, and sustainability.

However, the diet often involves consuming increased amounts of saturated fats, primarily from meat. This is associated with heightened cholesterol levels and heart disease risk.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, Professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they dissect the diet’s potential benefits, pitfalls, and sustainability.

      <title>Are low-fat diets bad for your health?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Each day this week, we’re examining one of the world’s most popular diets. Putting the latest scientific evidence under the microscope, we’ll find out these diets' true impact on your health.
Today we’re talking about the low-fat diet, popularised in the 1970s and fueled by the belief that fat was the culprit behind heart disease and weight gain.
However, the aftermath saw a surge in low-quality carbs. Food manufacturers, in the quest for low-fat options, replaced fats with sugar and refined grains, resulting in us opting for low-quality carbs over whole foods and whole grains.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, a professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they unravel the complexities of the low-fat diet, addressing its potential and pitfalls.

      <title>The keto diet uncovered: The truth about fat vs. carbs</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Each day this week, we’re examining one of the world’s most popular diets. Putting the latest scientific evidence under the microscope, we’ll find out these diets' true impact on your health.
Today we’re talking about the keto diet, a global phenomenon favoring fats over carbs, lauded for potential health benefits like improved blood sugar control and weight loss.
Yet, the allure of keto does come with downsides. With a dearth of fiber and essential nutrients — as well a reputation for being notoriously difficult to keep on top of long-term — many find ketosis elusive.
In this special episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Christopher Gardner, a professor of Medicine at Stanford University and the Director of Nutrition Studies at Stanford Prevention Research Center. Together, they unravel the keto diet's complexities, addressing its potential and pitfalls.

      <title>Why unhealthy carbs are making you sick, and what to do about it</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Do you realize how closely your diet affects your general health and well-being? Have you ever wondered how advertising affects what you eat? How much do you think your childhood diet is affecting your health in the long run?  
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by Prof. Walter Willett to discuss the importance of carefully considering what you eat and making decisions that support your health.
Professor Walter Willett, from the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, is the world's most cited nutritional scientist — with over 2,000 publications and several books to his name. Prof. Willett has focused much of his work over the last 40 years on the development and evaluation of methods to study the effects of diet on the occurrence of major diseases.

      <title>How body fat impacts health and aging</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>As we age, the distribution of our body fat changes, particularly around menopause.  
Most people think of body fat as bad, but fat tissue plays a number of hugely important roles in our health.
In today’s episode of ZOE Science and Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Dr. Sarah Berry and Prof. Deborah Clegg. Together, they debunk the myth that fat is bad, enlighten us about why body fat is distributed where it is, and explore the differences in fat distribution between men and women. 
Deborah Clegg is a professor and Vice President for Research at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso. Her research focuses on sex differences in metabolism, adipose tissue, and the brain and the impact this has on our health. Dr. Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition. She has run more than 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <itunes:summary>As we age, the distribution of our body fat changes, particularly around menopause.  
Most people think of body fat as bad, but fat tissue plays a number of hugely important roles in our health.
In today’s episode of ZOE Science and Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Dr. Sarah Berry and Prof. Deborah Clegg. Together, they debunk the myth that fat is bad, enlighten us about why body fat is distributed where it is, and explore the differences in fat distribution between men and women. 
Deborah Clegg is a professor and Vice President for Research at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, El Paso. Her research focuses on sex differences in metabolism, adipose tissue, and the brain and the impact this has on our health. Dr. Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition. She has run more than 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <title>Exercise myths busted: Practical steps to sustain your health</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Admit it, exercise isn't everyone's favorite pastime. Of course, our ancestors weren't hitting the gym by choice — our evolution has wired us to stay active, and this natural activity actually slows down the aging process.
The good news is that you can achieve the benefits without feeling like you're "exercising."
In today’s episode, Prof. Daniel Lieberman debunks exercise myths. He also teaches us how exercise impacts our health and how learning from our evolution can unlock the secrets of a longer life.
Daniel Lieberman is a paleoanthropologist at Harvard University. He’s the Edwin M. Lerner II Professor of Biological Sciences and a professor in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology. He’s best known for his research on the evolution of the human mind and the human body.

      <title>The surprising truth about lectins</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>What are lectins, and are they dangerous? These “antinutrients” have come under attack and were recently the subject of a dietary fad fueled by a popular book. As always, there’s more to the story.
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by Dr. Will Bulsiewicz to dive deep into the world of lectins. They dissect questionable studies, debunk myths, and offer expert advice about how to approach foods containing these misunderstood compounds.
Will is a board-certified gastroenterologist with 14 years of experience. He’s also the New York Times best-selling author of Fiber Fueled and ZOE’s U.S. medical director.

      <title>The surprising link between dementia and oral health</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>More than 50 systemic health conditions — including Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and heart disease — are associated with oral disease. 
The link between systemic and oral conditions is always microbial, inflammatory, or both. So, how can we look after our gums to improve our health?
In today’s episode, Jonathan and Prof. Alp Kantarci pose the question: How does the health of your oral cavity shape your general health?
Dr. Alp Kantarci is a professor, scientist, dentist, oral health researcher, periodontist, dental implant surgeon, and senior member of staff at the Forsyth Institute, an independent research institute that focuses on the connections between oral health and overall wellness. Dr. Kantarci is also a faculty member at Harvard University School of Dental Medicine. He has published more than 190 articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and has presented more than 170 talks and posters at dental and medical congresses.

      <description>Not all of us want to go to the gym 5 times a week, but what if there was a way to do quick, short high intensity 20 second exercises and still reap benefits - or does that sound too good to be true?
Javier and Jonathan break this down as they look at recent studies and results, optimizing exercise routines to achieve the desired health benefits, taking into account factors like intensity, duration, and frequency as well as discussing the effect of working from home vs commuting to the office.

      <title>Gut microbiome testing: What can it reveal about your health?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Your gut microbiome, a bustling community of microorganisms, is a vital player in your overall health. It doesn’t just impact your digestive system — it has a profound influence on your brain health and well-being.
However, the gut microbiome is a complex, long misunderstood realm, and figuring out how it affects daily life can leave even the most dedicated health enthusiasts scratching their heads. 
Here at ZOE, we’ve transformed our understanding of this bustling microbial world, where both “good” and “bad” gut bacteria reside.
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks with Prof. Nicola Segata and Prof. Tim Spector to explore how ZOE's microbiome testing and unique microbiome health scores provide personalized insights into your gut health.

      <title>The shocking damage ultra-processed foods cause to your brain</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>There’s been a surge in our consumption of ultra-processed foods, especially in the United Kingdom and the United States, where these foods contribute about two-thirds of people’s caloric intake.
Also a cause for concern is emerging evidence of ultra-processed foods’ detrimental effect on our brain health and overall well-being.
When most of our calories come from ultra-processed foods, the risk of chronic physical and mental health conditions escalates. Scientists are now uncovering the intricate mechanisms behind this relationship, particularly concerning the effects of these foods on our brains.
In today’s episode, we welcome back Prof. Felice Jacka, OAM. Felice is an Alfred Deakin professor of nutritional psychiatry and the director of the Food &amp; Mood Centre at Deakin University, in Australia. She’s also the founder of the International Society for Nutritional Psychiatry Research and the world’s leading researcher on food’s impact on our brain and mental health.
Now, she’s back on the show to delve deeper into the effects of ultra-processed foods on mental health and the brain, specifically the hippocampus, an area responsible for learning and memory.

Most of us like to have breakfast before we exercise in the morning, but what happens if we don’t eat anything first?
The issue goes beyond weight loss and exercise timing to involve blood sugar, insulin sensitivity, and other — perhaps unexpected — aspects of your health.
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Professor Javier Gonzalez ask: Should we exercise on an empty stomach?

      <title>Skin aging and acne: What you should do</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>As a listener to this show, you’ve probably heard of the gut microbiome. But did you know that your skin has its own microbiome? 
Recent evidence suggests that these microbiomes are vital for our skin health. So, what should we do? Which foods make an impact? 
And if we want our skin to look healthier, how about those collagen supplements that many of you have asked us about? 
In today’s episode, our guest is Dr. Justine Kluk, a consultant dermatologist with a specialist interest in acne. Justine is a member of the British Association of Dermatologists, the Royal Society of Medicine, and the Royal College of Physicians. 
ZOE’s Chief Scientist Dr. Sarah Berry also joins as a cohost to explore these ideas.

      <title>The great calorie deception: Are food labels misleading?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Millions of us are counting calories every day. But do we know if those numbers truly reflect the energy we get from eating?
It’s about time that we debunked the “one-size-fits-all” approach to calorie counting and unmasked the outdated methodologies that contribute to inaccuracies in food labeling.
In today’s episode, Jonathan and Dr. Sarah Berry ask: How exactly do we measure calories, and is calorie counting actually effective?

      <title>Antibiotics: The surprising truth about probiotics and what to do instead</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Antibiotics are one of the greatest discoveries of the 21st century. Since their inception, they’ve saved countless lives, but these miracle drugs come at a cost. In some cases, they can seriously affect your health or can even be life-threatening.
In today’s episode, Jonathan puts himself under the microscope. After an injury forced him to take antibiotics, he shows you the effect they had on his own gut bacteria.
Jonathan’s joined by Dr. Will Bulsiewicz and Prof. Tim Spector, who explore the impact of different types of antibiotics, how they affect your bacteria in the short and long term, and how we can reverse the unwanted effect of these drugs.

      <title>Healthy aging: The surprising power of your social life</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Unfortunately, many of us spend our later years in poor health. But is this avoidable? And can we actually increase our healthy years?
While aging is inevitable, there are steps we can take to minimize its effects on our health. And surprisingly, some of these steps have nothing to do with exercise or diet. Simply spending time with others can provide countless benefits to us as we age.
But how can we maintain these connections? Does retirement affect our social interactions? And can attitude alone keep you healthier in your later years?
In today’s episode, one of the world’s top experts on aging, Prof. Rose Anne Kenny, joins us to explore these ideas. 
Rose Anne is a world-leading geriatrician at Trinity College Dublin, where she leads a huge, long-term study on aging. She’s also the author of the number one international bestseller Age Proof: The New Science of Living a Longer and Healthier Life.

      <title>The truth about organic food - according to science</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>What does "organic" food mean? And how do you know if something's organic?
Of course, foods tell you if they're organic in massive letters on the packaging. And they cost way more. But what makes a food organic? Is eating organic better for your health? And are the benefits worth the expense?
Luckily, Professor Tim Spector is here today with answers. Tim is one of the world's top 100 most cited scientists, a scientific co-founder of ZOE, and the author of the bestselling book Food for Life: The New Science of Eating Well.
Stick around until the end, and you'll also find out the answer to a question we get often: Does Tim eat organic?

      <title>Is dairy good or bad for you?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Decades ago, there were reams of adverts instructing us to drink our milk so we don’t break our bones. But in the decades since, public opinion toward dairy is very different, and the scientific community has largely debunked these ideas. 
Many of the health-conscious among us choose to avoid it altogether. Our reasons range from a belief that dairy leads to inflammation, to acne, or even to an increased risk of heart attack due to high levels of saturated fat. 
But have we fallen into the same trap we often do, bouncing from one extreme to another? Could cutting out dairy mean we miss out on vital nutrients? Or could it hold the secret to a healthy gut microbiome?
Today, Jonathan is joined by ZOE regulars and renowned experts, Dr. Sarah Berry and Prof. Tim Spector.
In this episode, you’ll not only find out whether you should eat dairy or cut it out, but you’ll also hear two leading nutritional scientists try to reach an agreement on how to translate the latest research into actionable advice. And hopefully, they’ll still remain friends afterward.

      <title>How snacking impacts your health</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Evidence shows that all over the world, people are snacking more — with the United Kingdom and the United States leading the way in unhealthy snacking habits. 
But what exactly counts as a snack? And is all snacking unhealthy?
Snacking can be a confusing and controversial topic. There are various opinions and myths about what's good for you. Many people struggle to make healthy choices, while others may be unaware of the impact of snacking habits on their gut health and overall well-being.
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by ZOE regulars and renowned experts Sarah Berry and Tim Spector for an enlightening discussion that will help you snack smarter. 
Armed with the latest scientific research, they unravel the complexities of snacking and share evidence-based insights on what's truly beneficial for your body. Along the way, they cover healthy options, snack timing, and what we should all be avoiding.

      <title>The menstrual cycle decoded: Lifestyle tips to ease your symptoms, with Hazel Wallace</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>How much do you know about menstrual cycles? About half of us are more informed than the other half.
The menstrual cycle has great significance, affecting various aspects of health. And more than 90% of people who get their periods experience premenstrual symptoms.
However, misconceptions and limited understandings abound, leaving many people in the dark.
In today’s episode, we’re joined by Hazel Wallace. She’s a medical doctor, nutritionist, and author of The Female Factor. She’s here to give us an education about the menstrual cycle. 

Dr. Hazel Wallace describes how the cycle affects almost every aspect of the body, from heart health and sleep to metabolism. She also explains whether there’s scientific evidence behind “cycle syncing.”

Whether or not you’ve had a menstrual cycle, you’ll learn a lot from this episode.

      <title>Protein &amp; exercise: The secrets of healthy aging?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>As we age, our bodies undergo numerous changes, including a decline in muscle mass and cognitive function. For many of us, exercise and diet play crucial roles in maintaining our health and well-being. 
But how can the protein we eat affect our abilities to exercise and stay healthy as we age?
It can be difficult to separate fact from fiction when it comes to the effects of protein. How much do we need? Is it better to eat protein before or after exercise? And what roles do protein and exercise play in brain function?
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by Prof. Ben Wall, an expert in nutritional physiology at the University of Exeter. Together, they unpack the latest scientific research on the connection between protein consumption and exercise.

Prof. Ben Wall shares his insights into the optimal amount and timing of protein intake for building and maintaining muscle mass, as well as the potential impact of exercise on cognitive function and brain health into later life.

      <title>The surprising health impact of eating too fast</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>We’ve probably all been reprimanded for eating too fast at the dinner table or suffered the dreaded “itis” from eating way too much food at a family gathering. Our society and the systems we’ve developed to feed it have ballooned to such a point that they easily override our natural bodily systems that tell us when we’ve had enough to eat. 
When nearly 50% of the United States population is projected to have obesity by 2030, can something as simple as changing the speed with which we eat really be an effective tool for weight loss and sustaining a healthy body?
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: What is eating rate and does it have any impact on our health?
Studies referenced in the episode:

Does Eating Fast Make You Gain More Weight?

      <title>HRT for menopause: is it safe?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Menopause is a time of significant hormonal changes which can lead to a range of symptoms that can severely impact quality of life for many women. So, a drug that promises to reduce these symptoms is incredibly welcome, but it has been steeped in controversy.
HRT (Hormone replacement therapy) has been widely debated, with conflicting information about its effectiveness, with some suggesting HRT is outright dangerous. In fact, a massive study twenty years ago linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer. As a result, the numbers of women taking HRT plummeted. So should HRT be avoided at all costs? 
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by the author of that very study and esteemed Professor JoAnn Manson, alongside Dr. Sarah Berry to explore the science behind HRT.

Professor JoAnn Manson is a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and one of the world's most experts on HRT and menopause having run multiple enormous studies to uncover the effects of hormone replacement therapy on women’s health.

With the help of ZOE regular Dr. Sarah Berry, they delve into the science behind HRT, empowering listeners to make informed decisions about treatment for symptoms of the menopause.

      <itunes:summary>Menopause is a time of significant hormonal changes which can lead to a range of symptoms that can severely impact quality of life for many women. So, a drug that promises to reduce these symptoms is incredibly welcome, but it has been steeped in controversy.
HRT (Hormone replacement therapy) has been widely debated, with conflicting information about its effectiveness, with some suggesting HRT is outright dangerous. In fact, a massive study twenty years ago linked it to an increased risk of breast cancer. As a result, the numbers of women taking HRT plummeted. So should HRT be avoided at all costs? 
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by the author of that very study and esteemed Professor JoAnn Manson, alongside Dr. Sarah Berry to explore the science behind HRT.

Professor JoAnn Manson is a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and one of the world's most experts on HRT and menopause having run multiple enormous studies to uncover the effects of hormone replacement therapy on women’s health.

With the help of ZOE regular Dr. Sarah Berry, they delve into the science behind HRT, empowering listeners to make informed decisions about treatment for symptoms of the menopause.

      <title>How ultra-processed foods wreak havoc on your body</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Ultra-processed foods have become ubiquitous in modern diets. Many of us eat them regularly without understanding their potential impacts on our health. 
From hidden additives to addictive properties, these highly processed foods can pose risks. 
Navigating the complex world of ultra-processing can be challenging, and many people struggle to understand what to avoid, how to break unhealthy habits, and make positive changes to their health.
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by a special guest, Dr. Chris van Tulleken, to explore the science behind ultra-processed food.

Dr. Chris van Tulleken is an infectious diseases doctor at University College Hospital, in London, and one of the BBC’s leading science presenters. 

Chris shares the groundbreaking research from his own lived experiments, including the now famous study with his twin brother Xand. His book Ultra-Processed People is out now.
Jonathan and Chris are joined by ZOE regular Tim Spector. Drawing from their combined expertise, our guests provide practical tips and advice, empowering listeners to make informed choices and take control of their diets.

      <title>Why eating nuts makes you healthier, according to science</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: If nuts are so full of fat, can they really be good for us?
There is no shortage of variety when it comes to the mighty (yet humble) nut and the ways we consume them. Dried, chopped, made into butter or roasted (over an open fire, anyone?) these little guys provide the nutrients our brains and bodies need in surprisingly high quantities. From industrially farmed to indigenously hand-harvested, the story of these nuts is, well…nuts!

      <title>Protein: are you getting enough?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Proteins, carbs, and fats … most people understand what the last two are. Carbs are sugars, and fat is, well, fat. It's protein that’s so important to our diets, but so often misunderstood — by the general public, that is.
Since the 1950s and 1960s, scientists have been measuring how protein affects our performance, how it supports and maintains the body’s structure, and how best to incorporate it into our diets. 
From big steaks to protein shakes, tofu to seitan, protein is more available now than ever before. With so many options, surely we’re getting enough protein? 
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks with a leading nutritional researcher to find out.

Christopher Gardner is a professor at Stanford University and a member of ZOE’s scientific advisory board. He’s pioneering the movement to redefine how we understand the quality of our protein intake.

      <title>'Miracle' weight loss drug Ozempic is approved. But does it work?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>A miracle weight loss drug that’s approved in the US and the UK and has few side effects?
Ozempic is going viral on social media. Users are posting dramatic before and after pictures of their weight loss. An Ozempic trend is allegedly blossoming in Hollywood, and famous personalities like Elon Musk claim to have taken it. 
Many remain doubtful, dismissing the craze as just another internet scam preying on people’s insecurities. However, earlier this month - semaglutide - the drug’s active ingredient, was approved as a weight loss treatment by the UK’s National Health Service. Even the most sceptical are taking note.
Jonathan speaks to Dr Robert Kushner the lead investigator of the huge phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated the safety and effectiveness of semaglutide. He is a founder of the American Board of Obesity Medicine and hailed the drug as a ‘game-changer’ in regards to the treatment of obesity.
Please be aware: Dr. Kushner is also a consultant on the medical advisory board for Novo Nordisk - the company that manufactures semaglutide.

Dr Robert Kushner is a Professor of Medicine at Northwestern University and a founder of the American Board of Obesity Medicine.

      <title>Michael Mosley: 4 habits that changed his life</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>If you had to do just one thing to improve your health, what would it be?
Our busy lives mean it can be difficult to keep up healthy habits, and with so much conflicting advice out there it’s tricky to separate fact from fiction. In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by medical doctor, journalist, and presenter Michael Mosley, who is alongside ZOE regular Tim Spector, to discuss Michael’s four key habits to improve our health. 
Michael’s latest book ‘Just One Thing’ explores these habits and has seen him speak to singing scientists and eccentric iceman to healthy habit experts and evangelists. And of course, being Michael, he tried every habit out himself. We talk about which methods are the most effective, which he has incorporated into his life, and how he makes his new habits stick.

      <title>The future is here: AI and personalized healthcare with Eric Topol</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>If you were to ask Siri, Alexa, or ChatGPT for medical advice right now, that would be a terrible idea. 
But with recent developments in technology, this looks set to change. AI has become more intelligent, wearable devices - more accurate, and personalized medicine - increasingly mainstream.
But is any of this safe? Should we really trust machines with our health? And will any of this actually happen?
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to Eric Topol to explore how artificial intelligence may transform your next trip to the doctor.

Eric Topol is one of the top 10 most-cited researchers in medicine, the author of 3 bestselling books on the future of medicine, and a practising cardiologist.

      <description>Eggs are nutrient-dense and have a long shelf life. Compared with many other protein sources, they’re on the cheaper side. But they’re not as popular as they used to be. And a lot of this comes down to a debate about cholesterol.

      <title>How to maximize health in your later years</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Why do some people remain fit and healthy in their later years while others become increasingly frail?  
Researchers from Kings College London have been following thousands of twins for 30 years in an effort to understand how each of us ages differently. And some of their findings will surprise you!
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to Claire Steves to better understand what all this means, shedding light on how aging works and what we can do about it:

Dr. Claire Steves is a senior lecturer at King's College London, a medical doctor, and the clinical director at TwinsUK

      <itunes:summary>Why do some people remain fit and healthy in their later years while others become increasingly frail?  
Researchers from Kings College London have been following thousands of twins for 30 years in an effort to understand how each of us ages differently. And some of their findings will surprise you!
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to Claire Steves to better understand what all this means, shedding light on how aging works and what we can do about it:

      <title>The ultimate guide to constipation</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>The formal definition for constipation is ‘Having fewer than three bowel movements per week’. But, did you know that you can have a bowel movement every day and still be constipated? Recent data has shown that a quarter of people worldwide have at one point reported symptoms, suggesting that there is so much more to constipation than simply infrequent bowel movements.
In today’s short-ish episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Will attempt to dispel some misconceptions about constipation and empower you to have better bowel movements.  
Studies referenced in today’s episode: 

A redefinition of constipation by King’s College London, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019) here

Epidemiology of constipation in Europe and Oceania: a systematic review from Prichard &amp; Bharucha via BMC Gastroenterol here

      <title>How to eat well on a budget</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>The cost of living has soared. Energy prices have doubled, and food costs have gone up enormously. As a result, the weekly shopping bill can be shocking. 
For some, this is merely an inconvenience. But many others face the awful choice between heating their home and maintaining their usual diet. The consequence is that many of us are throwing cheaper ingredients into our shopping baskets to save money. 
So does this mean that eating healthy is an indulgence that be dropped in favour of cheap ultra-processed food? Or is it still possible to eat healthily on a budget?
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to Dr. Rupy Aujla and Tim Spector to better understand how to eat healthier while spending less:


Dr. Rupy Aujla is a medical doctor who, since 2015, has been teaching people to cook their way to health. He’s the founder of The Doctor’s Kitchen and has recently turned his efforts to healthy cooking on a tight budget.


Tim Spector is a co-founder of ZOE and one of the world's top 100 most cited scientists.

      <title>Signs of an unhealthy gut</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Our gut helps fight disease. It processes energy for us and boosts our mood. So, having a healthy gut is extremely important – but there’s still a lot we don’t know. 
Gut biome tests are a new, exciting technology, but are they the be-all and end-all for dietary decision-making? And are there simpler ways — and tastier ways, perhaps — to tell what’s happening inside our bodies?
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Dr. Will ask: What are the signs of an unhealthy gut? And how can we improve our gut health?

      <title>How to improve blood sugar control with exercise</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Blood sugar is one of the rare nutrition topics where everyone agrees: We should avoid big peaks and dips and aim for a steady curve. 
Spikes cause inflammation, accelerate aging, and lead to type 2 diabetes. Crashes make us feel moody and tired, and crave foods we don’t need. 
We can control our blood sugar through what and how we eat. But something else affects our blood sugar — physical activity. 
Exercise has a profound effect on your blood sugar response. Together with your food choices, being physically active helps you keep your blood sugar level even.
In this episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan speaks with Javier Gonzalez and Sarah Berry to find out how exercise affects our blood sugar response — even when we’re fasting — and how much exercise we need to do to benefit.


Javier Gonzalez is an associate professor of human physiology at the University of Bath whose research focuses on the interaction between diet and exercise.


Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition. She has personally run over 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <title>Foods to lower your cholesterol</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>More than half of us have high cholesterol — and new research suggests that having even slightly raised levels in our 30s could significantly increase our chances of developing heart disease. 
Medication is a common fix, but it comes with side effects. So, today we’re looking at how much changing our diets can help. 
In this short (ish) episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: Can we lower our cholesterol by changing our diets?

      <title>Should we be worried about strep A?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>This year, cases of an invasive bacterial infection are rising earlier than usual in the US, the UK and other countries across Europe. 
The group A Streptococcus bacteria - commonly known as Strep A - usually only causes mild illness. However, things have become severe in some cases, with several children dying in recent weeks.
So, should we be worried? And what symptoms should we look out for to help us identify this illness in ourselves and our families?
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by world-leading expert on the subject: Shiranee Sriskandan is a professor of Infectious Diseases at Imperial College London whose scientific research focuses specifically on Strep A bacteria. Regular guest and ZOE co-founder Tim Spector also joins, and as one of the world’s top 100 most cited scientists, Tim has been closely following infectious diseases in the community through the ZOE Health Study.

This tradition dates back 4000 years, so it’s certainly stood the test of time. But are new year’s resolutions a good idea? Or simply a get way to set yourself up to fail? 
Perhaps science has something to say about this.
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with Tara Swart and Sarah Berry, who share techniques that will give you the best chance of sticking to your New Year’s resolutions. They also discuss whether these promises are a good idea in the first place. 


Tara Swart is a medical doctor, a neuroscientist, and the author of The Source: Open Your Mind, Change Your Life. She also has her own podcast, called Reinvent Yourself.


Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition. She has personally run more than 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <title>The health benefits of eating together</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>You might think what you eat and when are the only factors that play into the health of your diet. But recent research has shown that who you eat with can also play a role. And it could even make your food taste better!
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: Can eating with other people really improve your food? 
Studies referenced in today’s episode: 

Associations of family feeding and mealtime practices with children's overall diet quality, published in Appetite here


‘Diet and Health Benefits Associated with In-Home Eating and Sharing Meals at Home’ from International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health here


‘The Protective Role of Family Meals for Youth Obesity: 10-year Longitudinal Associations’ from the U.S. Dept of Health and Human Services here

      <description>What should I have for dinner? A question you no doubt ask yourself daily. But I bet you don't spend too long coming up with an answer. ZOE's scientific co-founder, Tim Spector, has been trying to answer this question for a decade.
If you're a regular listener, you probably know him well. Five years ago, he published the best-selling book, The Diet Myth, and just last month, he released the follow-up, Food for Life, the New Science of Eating Well. 
In this episode, you'll hear a chapter from the book titled “So Now What Should I Have for Dinner?”

Tim Spector is a co-founder of ZOE and one of the world's top 100 most-cited scientists.

      <title>Should you worry about gluten?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>The last decade saw a rise in gluten-free diets. But the number of us with diagnosed gluten intolerance each year hasn’t changed. 
Eliminating gluten is the only treatment for those with celiac disease, but the rest of us could be doing more harm than good by embracing ultra-processed, gluten-free foods. 
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Will ask: Should you be worried about gluten?
Studies referenced in the episode: 

‘Health Benefits and Adverse Effects of a Gluten-Free Diet in Non–Celiac Disease Patients’ from Gastroenterol &amp; Hepatology here


‘The Gluten-Free Diet: Recognizing Fact, Fiction, and Fad’ from The Journal of Pediatrics here


’Is There Evidence to Support the Claim that a Gluten-Free Diet Should Be Used for Weight Loss?’ from the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics here

      <title>The secrets of good sleep</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>We all know how good it feels to drift into deep sleep and wake up feeling refreshed. 
The positive effects of a good night’s sleep affect every aspect of our lives. We feel energetic, focused, and ready to take on the day’s challenges.  
But the long-term effects of bad sleep are less known. It turns out, they have a huge impact on our health and even how long we live.  
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with Prof. Matthew Walker to learn what the latest science says about improving our sleep — to give us more energy and better health. They also discuss whether how we sleep changes how our bodies respond to food.

Matthew Walker is a sleep expert, a professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley, and founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science. He’s also the author of Why We Sleep. 
Matt and his team are currently working with ZOE scientists to research the links between sleep, nutrition, and health.

      <itunes:summary>We all know how good it feels to drift into deep sleep and wake up feeling refreshed. 
The positive effects of a good night’s sleep affect every aspect of our lives. We feel energetic, focused, and ready to take on the day’s challenges.  
But the long-term effects of bad sleep are less known. It turns out, they have a huge impact on our health and even how long we live.  
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with Prof. Matthew Walker to learn what the latest science says about improving our sleep — to give us more energy and better health. They also discuss whether how we sleep changes how our bodies respond to food.

Matthew Walker is a sleep expert, a professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley, and founder of the Center for Human Sleep Science. He’s also the author of Why We Sleep. 
Matt and his team are currently working with ZOE scientists to research the links between sleep, nutrition, and health.

      <title>Heartburn: why it happens and what you can do</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>The acid in your stomach is so powerful it can dissolve metal. Luckily, your stomach is fine-tuned to deal with its acidic fluid, but the rest of your body isn’t quite as hardy. 
So, if acid escapes from your stomach and reaches your esophagus, it can cause a painful sensation in the chest — this is heartburn. It isn’t rare, with more than 1 billion people suffering from it globally. 
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Will ask: Why do we get heartburn, and what’s the best way to deal with it?

      <title>The truth about vitamin supplements</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Good information about vitamins is hard to find. With over 70% of Americans and 40% of Brits using them, it's a hugely lucrative market, which means numerous voices in the media and online pusing a pro-vitamin agenda. All without the scientific evidence to support their claims. 
So do we need vitamins to lead a healthy life? Or could these supplements actually cause serious health complications?
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with Prof. JoAnn Manson and Dr. Sarah Berry to better understand how vitamin supplements affect our health.


JoAnn Manson is a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and one of the world's most cited researchers. She’s run multiple enormous studies with over 20,000 participants to uncover the real effects of vitamin supplementation on our health.


Dr. Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition, who has personally run over 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <title>Menopause: Does diet play a part?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>It's a condition that affects half the population, but there are countless unanswered questions about menopause. The symptoms vary significantly from person to person, including sleep problems, hot flashes, weight gain, and an increased risk of heart disease. 
In one of the largest studies to date, ZOE researchers have uncovered a link between menopause and our diets — and this could hold the key to reducing the severity of menopause symptoms. 
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: what role does diet play during menopause?

      <title>How your gut affects your mental health</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>In a lab in Ireland, a group of scientists stand around a stainless steel table. One of them is holding a device, not unlike a small turkey baster. His free hand plunges into a box on the table and retrieves a mouse.  
Using his device, he administers the brown solution within…rectally. 
This unfortunate soul has just received a fecal microbiota transplant. The donor was not another mouse but a human being. And the person in question had symptoms of severe depression. 
Jonathan speaks to John Cryan, author of the study that showed a relationship between gut and brain. In this episode, we learn more about his fascinating research, how microbes may affect our brain, and to eat to appease your gut bugs. 

John Cryan is a professor at University College Cork and a world-leading researcher into the relationship between our brain and our gut microbiome.

      <itunes:summary>In a lab in Ireland, a group of scientists stand around a stainless steel table. One of them is holding a device, not unlike a small turkey baster. His free hand plunges into a box on the table and retrieves a mouse.  
Using his device, he administers the brown solution within…rectally. 
This unfortunate soul has just received a fecal microbiota transplant. The donor was not another mouse but a human being. And the person in question had symptoms of severe depression. 
Jonathan speaks to John Cryan, author of the study that showed a relationship between gut and brain. In this episode, we learn more about his fascinating research, how microbes may affect our brain, and to eat to appease your gut bugs. 

John Cryan is a professor at University College Cork and a world-leading researcher into the relationship between our brain and our gut microbiome.

      <title>Will fermented foods improve my gut health?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Fermentation is a hot craze in fancy restaurants around the world. And fermented foods, like kombucha and kimchi, are even sold in corner stores. 
Listeners of this show will have heard that fermented foods might benefit our gut health. But these foods make us uneasy. The idea of letting food rot, then eating it goes against everything our parents taught us. So, is fermentation scary and dangerous? 
This episode will show you why it's not only safe but beneficial to eat fermented foods, and that fermenting foods is something you can try at home. 
Jonathan speaks to Tim Spector and Sandor Katz — whom the food magazine CHOW calls a provocateur, trendsetter, and rabble-rouser — to better understand the fabulous world of fermentation. 


Sandor Katz is a food activist who is widely credited with reintroducing fermentation to the US and the UK, calling himself a fermentation revivalist.


Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world.

      <title>How fasting affects energy and mood - The Big IF Dailies</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Have you ever lost your temper because you were hungry? Feeling short-tempered when you’re overdue a bite to eat is an almost universal experience, with its own adjective - ‘hangry’. If missing just one meal turns you into a grump, you may think that fasting would turn you into the Incredible Hulk. However, new data suggests this might not be the case. 
In this daily episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Dr Sarah Berry joins Jonathan to answer the question: how does fasting affect your energy and mood?
This episode is part of a limited series to celebrate the launch of The Big IF Study: The world’s largest clinical study to discover how intermittent fasting affects our mood, energy and hunger levels. Want to know if intermittent fasting can work for you?

      <title>3 meals a day VS little and often - The Big IF Dailies</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Can you make it from lunch to dinner without a snack? Tradition tells us that three meals a day is the right way to eat, but times have changed, and many of us now choose to eat little and often. The debate continues as to which is better. 
Today, we discuss new data that could settle this once and for all.
In this daily episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan is joined by Dr Sarah Berry to answer the question: should we eat little and often or 3 meals a day?

Yet new evidence suggests that when we snack is less important than what we snack on, so suddenly that midnight snack may not be a guilty pleasure after all.

      <title>What breaks a fast? - The Big IF Dailies</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Fasting has been shown to improve our metabolism, slow disease and potentially increase our life span. While world religions have practiced fasting for millennia, the trend of fasting has soared in popularity in the last decade. 
Not all fasts are made equally and there are a lot of different rules to follow. Some purists argue that you’re only allowed water while fasting others believe there can be more flexibility during your period of abstinence.

      <title>5 foods I got wrong - Tim Spector</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Where were you in 2015? President Obama was in the White House, The UK was a member of the European Union, and you couldn’t escape Bruno Mars's global smash: Uptown Funk. More importantly, 2015 marked the release of Tim Spector’s first book: The Diet Myth.
If you think the world has felt different since 2015, wait until you hear about the advances in nutritional science. Since then, Tim has had a chance to rethink his position on dietary staples like bread, milk, ultra-processed foods and more. 
He’s put everything he’s learnt into his new book Food for Life: The New Science of Eating Well. 
In this episode, Tim speaks with Jonathan about what he got right, where he went wrong, and what the future holds for the world of nutrition. 

Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the world's top 100 most cited scientists.

      <title>What does science say about intermittent fasting?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>It seems like every day, someone new mentions intermittent fasting. But what is it, exactly? 
There are myriad options — from the 5:2 diet, with two days of extreme calorie restriction each week, to the warrior diet, which involves eating only raw fruit during the day and a mammoth feast at night. 
Whatever the approach, intermittent fasting involves restricting the window of time when you eat.
Supporters evangelise the benefits, promising weight loss, disease prevention, and even life extension. 
Currently, the scientific evidence is unclear, but it's an exciting area that may be full of potential. 
Today, Jonathan speaks with Gin Stephens, who has had a powerful experience of intermittent fasting transforming her health and weight. He also talks to Tim Spector, who will share what science can tell us about intermittent fasting today —  and, interestingly, how much it can’t, yet. Plus, an exciting announcement about how this is set to change.


Gin Stephens is a New York Times bestselling author and podcast host.


Tim Spector is a co-founder of ZOE and one of the world's top 100 most cited scientists.

      <title>Fiber: Why it’s important and how to get more of it</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Diets rich in fiber are associated with good heart health and metabolic wellbeing. This type of diet can do wonders for our gut microbiome. 
With so many benefits, relatively low cost, and high availability, fiber should be a staple nutrient in our diets — but most of us have a deficiency.
 
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Will ask: If fiber is so good for us, why are we not eating enough of it?

      <title>Heart health and aging</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Do our blood vessels hold the secret to long life?
60,000 miles long. That’s the length of the tube system inside us that transports blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the cells in our body. 
If these tubes fail, the result can be fatal. In some cases, it’s a heart attack. In others, it’s a stroke, where the blood supply to the brain is disrupted, and brain cells are damaged or killed. 
Heart attacks and strokes are a major cause of death in developed countries - but we can take action to reduce the risks. 
In this episode, Jonathan speaks to a world-renowned physician, scientist, and speaker to gain insights into how looking after this magical pipework could slow down aging. 

Dr. William Li is a world-leading specialist in blood vessels and preventative health and the author of countless papers on the topic, who possesses the gift for communicating this complex subject in terms we can all understand.

      <title>Gas &amp; Bloating: the causes &amp; how to stop it</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Most of us are familiar with the unpleasant feeling of being bloated. It can happen after eating specific foods or when you experience slower bowel movements. Sometimes, it can be a symptom of an underlying health condition. 
To take a closer look at issues related to gas and bloating, we’ve invited a special guest this week: superstar gastroenterologist and Zoe’s US Medical Director Will Bulsiewicz.
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Will ask: what are the main causes of gas bloating and how do we stop it?

      <title>How your food choices affect the planet</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Our planet is overheating. Human society is creating too much carbon dioxide, stopping the sun’s warmth from escaping back into space. As earth gets hotter, its ice caps are melting, causing sea levels to rise, and submerging entire communities. Floods, droughts, and wildfires are already becoming much more common.
Some effects of climate change are now irreversible, but there is still hope, and adjusting what we eat might play a bigger part than you’d imagine.
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with a pioneer in science who will help you understand how your eating habits affect the planet, so you can make informed decisions about the foods you eat and how you prepare them.

Sarah Bridle is a professor of food climate and society at the University of York in the United Kingdom. She is on the vanguard of a new field, and her research carefully measures the exact effects of the foods we eat on climate change.

      <itunes:summary>Our planet is overheating. Human society is creating too much carbon dioxide, stopping the sun’s warmth from escaping back into space. As earth gets hotter, its ice caps are melting, causing sea levels to rise, and submerging entire communities. Floods, droughts, and wildfires are already becoming much more common.
Some effects of climate change are now irreversible, but there is still hope, and adjusting what we eat might play a bigger part than you’d imagine.
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with a pioneer in science who will help you understand how your eating habits affect the planet, so you can make informed decisions about the foods you eat and how you prepare them.

Sarah Bridle is a professor of food climate and society at the University of York in the United Kingdom. She is on the vanguard of a new field, and her research carefully measures the exact effects of the foods we eat on climate change.

      <title>How to make your body clock work for you</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>In today’s world, we increasingly live our lives late into the night. Whether it's work obligations, socializing, or being glued to a screen, we ignore the sun's rise and fall. 
But most of us are unaware that a clock is ticking away inside us. 
It uses light to keep time and tells us when to sleep and eat. Should we listen? Or is this biological clock simply a relic from a past time?
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to a leading authority to unravel the latest science that reveals that this body clock, or circadian rhythm, has a dramatic impact on our health, weight, and mental wellbeing:

Russell Foster is an Oxford University scientist who has dedicated his life to studying circadian rhythms. He’s a world leader in the field and the author of Lifetime: the new science of the body clock.

      <link>http://joinzoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Artificial sweeteners are everywhere. Not only in diet soft drinks but in many foods that you wouldn’t expect. You’ve probably eaten some today without realising.
Sweeteners have been around for over a hundred years yet remain the subject of much debate. It's hard to know how they stack up next to the alternatives.
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: are artificial sweeteners worse than sugar?

      <title>Can spices improve your health?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Kanchan Koya grew up in a house filled with wonderful fragrances from the spices simmering on her grandmother’s stove. In India, it was a common belief that spices were more than just pleasant tastes. Ancient wisdom said they had medicinal properties, and it was common for household medicine cabinets to store dried spices, not pills.
Kanchan grew up to become a molecular biologist, studying in the US at Harvard Medical School. When her lab began to investigate turmeric’s healing properties, the ancient wisdom from her childhood met the scientific inquiry of her adult life - beginning a lifelong obsession with the health benefits of spice. 
 
In today’s episode, Kanchan and regular guest Tim Spector help us understand whether there is any scientific evidence to support the health benefits of spices, the easiest way to add spice to our diet, and which ones to choose.


Kanchan Koya is the founder of SpiceSpiceBaby and The Radical Vitality Podcast with a Ph.D. in Biomedicine from Harvard University and training from the Institute of Integrative Nutrition.


Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world.

      <itunes:summary>Kanchan Koya grew up in a house filled with wonderful fragrances from the spices simmering on her grandmother’s stove. In India, it was a common belief that spices were more than just pleasant tastes. Ancient wisdom said they had medicinal properties, and it was common for household medicine cabinets to store dried spices, not pills.
Kanchan grew up to become a molecular biologist, studying in the US at Harvard Medical School. When her lab began to investigate turmeric’s healing properties, the ancient wisdom from her childhood met the scientific inquiry of her adult life - beginning a lifelong obsession with the health benefits of spice. 
 
In today’s episode, Kanchan and regular guest Tim Spector help us understand whether there is any scientific evidence to support the health benefits of spices, the easiest way to add spice to our diet, and which ones to choose.


Kanchan Koya is the founder of SpiceSpiceBaby and The Radical Vitality Podcast with a Ph.D. in Biomedicine from Harvard University and training from the Institute of Integrative Nutrition.


Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world.

      <link>http://joinzoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Vegan diets are increasingly popular. As more of us reduce our animal product consumption, countless new meat and dairy alternatives appear on our supermarket shelves. Manufacturers market these products as healthy options (unsurprisingly), but perhaps we shouldn’t be so quick to trust them… 
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: are meat and dairy alternatives healthier than their animal-based counterparts?

      <title>How food can improve your mood</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>We’ve all felt the effects of food on our mood, so it would stand to reason that dietary intervention for mental health would be well studied and a regularly deployed treatment. 
But this is far from reality, as historically, psychiatry was only concerned with what happened from the neck up.
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by Felice Jacka, Professor of Nutritional Psychiatry and Director of the Food &amp; Mood Centre at Deakin University. Felice was the driving force behind the landmark study to determine if dietary intervention could help treat the symptoms of moderate to severe depression. 
With her help, we dive into what the science suggests regarding the relationship between food and our mental health and what foods we can eat to improve it.

      <description>A recent study claims that eating a hotdog reduces life expectancy by 38 minutes, and eating salmon could extend it by 70 minutes. At face value, this data implies you can eat your way to immortality. Taken with a pinch of salt, it suggests you can offset the harm from poor dietary choices. But does food really work this way?

      <title>How to control blood sugar spikes</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Biochemist Jessie Inchauspe heads into work one morning at a genetics lab in California. During the morning meeting, management offer staff the chance to self-test a new medical device. Jessie accepts. 
She couldn’t have known this device would take her on a journey of discovery to reshape her health and help countless others do the same.  
The device was a continuous blood sugar monitor, and it was this, combined with her academic background, and a remarkable willingness to use herself as a lab rat, that began a journey of discovery into how blood sugar affects our health. 
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by two leading experts on the topic:


Jessie Inchauspe is a biochemist, bestselling author, and founder of the Glucose Goddess movement who’s helped hundreds of thousands of people improve their health by making cutting-edge science accessible.


Dr. Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition, who has personally run over 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <itunes:summary>Biochemist Jessie Inchauspe heads into work one morning at a genetics lab in California. During the morning meeting, management offer staff the chance to self-test a new medical device. Jessie accepts. 
She couldn’t have known this device would take her on a journey of discovery to reshape her health and help countless others do the same.  
The device was a continuous blood sugar monitor, and it was this, combined with her academic background, and a remarkable willingness to use herself as a lab rat, that began a journey of discovery into how blood sugar affects our health. 
In today’s episode, Jonathan is joined by two leading experts on the topic:


Jessie Inchauspe is a biochemist, bestselling author, and founder of the Glucose Goddess movement who’s helped hundreds of thousands of people improve their health by making cutting-edge science accessible.


Dr. Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition, who has personally run over 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <title>This is what the Keto Diet does to your body...</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Keto has been promoted as a magic bullet for weight loss by its supporters and slammed as dangerous by its opponents. It's no surprise - completely removing almost all carbohydrates is not what most people consider ‘a balanced diet’.
With carbs off the table, Keto diets involve a dramatically increased fat intake. At the same time, drastically reducing carbs means starving our gut microbes of the fiber that feeds them. 
Nonetheless, doctors prescribe keto diets to treat people with severe diabetes and see dramatic improvements, and many healthy people swear by keto for weight loss. On top of this, removing carbohydrates prevents blood sugar spikes and crashes linked to inflammation and disease. 
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to a leading nutritional researcher to understand whether or not keto diets are a crazy fad:

Christopher Gardner is a professor at Stanford University and a member of ZOE’s scientific advisory board who’s produced a clinical trial of keto diets, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

      <description>The word ‘processed’ has become synonymous with being unhealthy. The mainstream media encourages us to detox from processed food or offers us ‘10 easy ways’ to stop eating it. 
But nearly everything we consume has undergone some type of processing.
In today’s short episode of ZOE Science &amp; Nutrition, Jonathan and Sarah ask: If most of what we eat is processed, can it really be that unhealthy for us?

      <title>Our ancestors’ diet: surprising discoveries from a 5000 year old iceman</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>A mummified man found in the mountains of Italy on a nutrition science podcast? Have we gone completely off track? 
We haven’t - we promise. 
This unfortunate soul could be the key that unlocks an entirely new understanding of human health. 
This mummy, discovered in an alpine snow drift by two hikers, gives us a remarkable glimpse into the surprising dietary choices of our ancestors.
In today’s episode, Jonathan discovers some secrets held by our ancestors by speaking to two outstanding guests:


Frank Maixner works at the Institute for Mummy Studies in Italy and travels the world uncovering the secrets of our ancestors.


Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world.

      <title>Inflammation, aging and disease. What's food got to do with it?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>It’s a biological process that we need to stay alive. Yet too much of it leads to disease and a shorter life. 
Inflammation is the immune system’s response to an outside event it thinks is dangerous. This stimulus could be an injury, like falling off your bike or an infection by a virus or bacteria. But inflammation can also be triggered by our food in the hours after we eat. 
But if this natural process is required to protect us from infections and injuries, why is inflammation usually cast in a negative light? Is there something behind this, or is the idea that inflammation is bad a lie, designed to sell magic potions with dubious evidence? 
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to two show regulars to unravel all the information about inflammation:


Dr. Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition, who has personally run over 20 randomized clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.


Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world.

      <title>Can bread be healthy?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>It’s no exaggeration to say that bread shaped modern humanity - it was the cultivation of wheat for flour that transformed our ancestors from hunter-gatherers to city dwellers. 
Today, millions of us start the day with a slice of toast, and most lunches in the US and UK are wrapped in a slice of bread or a burger bun as a cheap, flexible, and delicious energy source.
But modern industrial processes designed to reduce the time and cost of baking mean today’s bread would be unrecognizable to our ancestors.  
Today’s bread tastes good but has lost most of its nutritional content. With most of its fiber gone, and no time for bacteria to work its fermenting magic, bread has become a simple starch, rapidly turned into sugar in our blood and offering little to support our gut bacteria. For this reason, bread is increasingly demonized as an evil carb.
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to two authorities on the subject to ask: Can bread can ever be healthy?


Vanessa Kimbel is a specialist in personalised bread and her doctorate in nutrition &amp; digestabilty of bread is in Baking as Lifestyle Medicine &amp; preventative healthcare.


Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world.

      <title>Is Coffee Healthy?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Coffee’s earliest consumption dates back millennia when the tribesmen of Ethiopia used its ground-up berries to help aid concentration during prayer. 
Arriving in Europe in the 17th century, Coffee quickly began to replace beer and wine as a favourite breakfast drink. 
In the 20th century, coffee was blamed for high blood pressure and heart attacks, and more recently linked to a rising epidemic of poor sleep. 
None of this has prevented coffee’s relentless rise. Over 2 billion cups of the stuff are drunk each day. 
So, is coffee a guilty treat as many of us suspect? Or is it a health drink feeding your good gut bacteria? 
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with James Hoffmann and Tim Spector to find out. They discuss how coffee affects your gut bacteria, your hormones and your heart, whether decaffeinated coffee is healthy, and discover some of coffee’s most surprising side effects – which could come in handy if you find yourself in the jungle.


James Hoffmann is a leading coffee expert and author of the World Atlas of Coffee and co-founder &amp; chairman of the Square Mile Coffee Roasters.


Tim Spector is a co-founder at ZOE and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world.

      <title>Your Gut is Full of Bugs: Why This is Great News</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>You may have heard there are bugs in your gut. But do they matter? 
Today, the evidence shows the answer is a resounding yes. This ecosystem of tiny microbes living in our bodies is one of the most exciting areas in medical research, linked to everything from metabolic to mental health.
So while many of us have heard that gut health is essential, few of us understand why and what we should do to support our gut bacteria.
In this episode, Jonathan speaks with Will Bulsiewicz to find out when our microbiome begins to form, the most effective ways to support our gut health, and the role these gut bacteria play in controlling our weight.

Will Bulsiewicz is a board-certified gastroenterologist, and New York Times bestselling author of the microbiome book Fiber Fueled.

      <title>Fats and oils: What’s the real story?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Today we’re talking about fat, a delicious component of our food with a terrible reputation.  
Fats have been broadly associated with weight gain and heart disease until recently.
A mountain of new scientific evidence suggests this is wrong and that it's not as simple as ‘all fat is bad’. Indeed, eating more healthy fat might actually reduce heart disease for many people.  
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to Dr Sarah Berry to learn about what science tells us today, whether it is possible to lose weight on a high-fat diet, what oils we should be cooking with, and the different types of fats.

Dr. Sarah Berry is one of the world's leading experts on human nutrition, who has personally run over 20 randomised clinical trials looking at how humans respond to different fats.

      <title>Is exercise or nutrition more important for weight loss?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>Our transformation into coach potatoes happened in the blink of an eye. Only 100 years ago, most people relied on manual work to make their living. 
Today, things are different. Many of us live our lives in front of a screen. Online shopping and remote work mean some of us don’t need to leave the house at all. So how bad is this for us? 
The answer is now clear: Low levels of physical activity lead to an increased risk of disease and a lower quality of life in older age. However, when we come to the question of what sort of exercise you should be doing, how often, and how much it contributes to weight loss, the answers might surprise you.
In today’s episode, Jonathan speaks to a Human Physiologist to learn about the interactions between diet and exercise and their impact on human health:

Dr. Javier Gonzalez is an associate professor of Human Physiology at the University of Bath and also a technical advisor to the athletes in the INEOS Tour de France cycling team.

      <title>Menopause: How your body changes and what you can do</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>There's a condition that leads to an increased risk of heart disease, dementia, and early death that's been affecting people for as long as they've existed. The many symptoms can severely impact quality of life - ranging from headaches and memory problems to anxiety and weight gain. 
This condition affects more than half of the world's population, but unbelievably its rarely discussed and the scientific research that exists on it is limited. 
It's called menopause, and it affects 1.2 billion women worldwide. It's not a disease, but the effects can be just as serious for some women.
Jonathan talks to the British doctor who's working to educate us about menopause and bring the discussion on the topic into the mainstream.
Dr Louise Newson is a GP, menopause specialist and founder of the Newson Health Menopause &amp; Wellbeing Center. Director of the Balance Menopause App and the non-profit Newson Health Research and Education. Founder of The Menopause Charity.

      <title>Alcohol: Can it ever be healthy?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>For many of us, it's a ritual to help us wind down after a long day, an excuse to catch up with friends, or a lubricant to an awkward social situation. Alcohol can be delicious, but our relationship with it is often complicated. 
Good times with friends aren’t without sacrifice, and many of us feel the morning after impact of a few too many drinks. For an unfortunate minority, alcohol can lead to addiction and even death. 
What we want to know is, can alcohol ever be healthy? Is any amount of alcohol a sure path to an early grave, or could a glass of red wine be the best thing for your heart health? This episode examines these contradictions to see what the science says. 
Jonathan speaks to two leading scientists to better understand the effects of alcohol:


Tim Spector - scientific co-founder at Zoe and one of the top 100 most cited scientists in the world


Dr. Sarah Berry - one of the world's leading experts in human nutrition, with over 30 randomised human clinical trials to her name

      <title>Is Dark Chocolate Good for Weight Loss?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>This plant has been used by human beings for thousands of years with samples found in 5000-year-old pottery discovered in the upper Amazon. The Mayans considered it a gift from the gods and used it in their sacred ceremonies, where it was believed to have mystical healing powers. For the Aztecs, it was worth more than gold and given to their victorious warriors. 
We are talking, of course, about chocolate. Even though our relationship with chocolate spans thousands of years we still can’t agree about it. It seems obvious that something so delicious must be bad for us. Can there be any truth to the claims that chocolate can improve our mood, our health and even our libido? 
Jonathan speaks to Professor Tim Spector, one of the world's top 100 most cited scientists and author of the diet myth, and Spencer Hyman, one of the world’s leading chocolate experts and founder of the craft chocolate business Cocoa Runners.

      <title>Food Intolerances: What's the Story?</title>
      <link>http://zoe.com/podcast</link>
      <description>1 in 5 people suffer from food intolerances, a figure that’s growing each year. As a result, people are eating increasingly restricted diets, removing dairy, gluten and many other foods from their plates. Unfortunately, they end up eating highly processed foods that damage their gut microbiome and lead to long-term health problems. Even with food restrictions, many people see limited improvements in their symptoms.
The whole topic of intolerance is full of pseudoscience, dubious blood tests, and miracle cures.
However, in the last few years, we have seen a revolution in our understanding, with gut bacteria now the stars of the show. This new understanding has profound implications for how we should treat our food intolerances. 
Today we’ll focus on what the latest science says. Jonathan is joined by Will Bulsiewicz, board-certified gastroenterologist, New York Times best-selling author and ZOE's science board member, whose latest book is all about food intolerance.
