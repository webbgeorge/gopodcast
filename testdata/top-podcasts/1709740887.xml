    <description>Gary Brecka is a Human Biologist, biohacker, researcher, and an anti-aging and longevity expert. His approach to health is simple: "Aging is the aggressive pursuit of comfort.‚Äù

For over 20 years, he worked in the life insurance industry predicting mortality. This meant if he got 5 years of medical records and 5 years of demographic data on you, the team that he was associated with could tell a life insurance company how long you had to live to the month. After years and years of doing this type of research and analysis, he decided he wanted to spend the balance of his lifetime helping people live happier, healthier, longer, more fulfilling lives.

With this mission in mind, he created The Ultimate Human podcast. In this weekly podcast, Gary has exciting conversations with celebrities, athletes, entrepreneurs, and scientists and is thrilled to share their transformative insights with you. What‚Äôs keeping you from being an ultimate human? Tune in to find out.

      <title>135. Lauryn &amp; Michael Bosstick: The Unfiltered Truth About Running a Business With Your Spouse</title>
      <description>Building a business is hard. Building it with your spouse is supposedly impossible. Yet, Lauryn and Michael Bosstick turned their 12-year-old playground romance into a successful digital media empire, The Skinny Confidential, that proves love and business can be a winning combination. In this episode, this power couple shares the unfiltered truth about working together, and how they have carried on their shared vision not only to their audiences, but also to their children. What could you build if you stopped seeing your relationship as a business liability, and started seeing it as your secret weapon?

      <title>127. Dr. Mink Chawla: Blood Filter Seraph-100 Shows Promise To End Long COVID</title>
      <description>In this episode, Chief Medical Officer at Exthera Medical and President of Stavro Medical Division, Dr. Mink Chawla, reveals the DARPA-backed breakthrough that's revolutionizing medicine: the Seraph-100 filter. This ingenious device packs the surface area of a football field into something the size of your thumb, creating the ultimate biological "honey trap" for everything from viruses to cancer cells. Is this the future of medicine we've been waiting for?

For those interested in learning more about the Long Covid clinical trial, they should contact longcovidtrial@lumati.com.

The Seraph-100 filter is made by Exthera Medical and the co-inventors of the filter are Robert Ward PhD and Keith McCrea PhD.

      <title>101. Max Lugavere: The 16 Year Alzheimer's Research Scandal Exposed</title>
      <description>Did you know that 99.6% of Alzheimer's drug trials fail? In this eye-opening episode of the Ultimate Human Podcast, host Gary Brecka sits down with health and science journalist Max Lugavere, to uncover the truth about Alzheimer's research and its implications for brain health. They discuss the shocking revelation of how a fraudulent 2006 paper misled Alzheimer‚Äôs research for 16 years! Max explains why medications that reduce brain plaques don't necessarily improve cognition, and some may even accelerate brain atrophy.

      <title>96. The MTHFR Gene: Why Your Vitamins Might Be Useless (And What to Do)</title>
      <description>Did you know that nearly 44-60% of the population could unknowingly carry a gene mutation that impacts their health in significant ways? The MTHFR gene mutation plays a critical role in how our bodies process folic acid, which is essential for various bodily functions, from brain health to pregnancy. If your body can‚Äôt properly convert folic acid into its active form, 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, it can lead to a range of issues like infertility, miscarriages, ADHD, mood disorders, and digestive problems. In this episode, Gary Brecka reveals studies on how personalized supplementation can be the key to unlocking better health for you!

      <title>95. Calley Means: Exposing the Secrets of the Food and Healthcare Industry</title>

In this episode, Calley Means and Gary Brecka expose the shocking truth behind the food and healthcare industries, revealing how big corporations have manipulated what we eat for profit. Once dominated by cigarette companies, the food industry has used the same strategies that made cigarettes addictive to engineer ultra-processed foods that hijack our biology.

Have you ever wondered if you‚Äôre health issues could be symptoms of Hyperthyroidism? Gary Brecka is breaking down the latest science, treatments, and what you can do to combat it. Hyperthyroidism, an endocrine disorder characterized by the overproduction of thyroid hormones, significantly disrupts the body's metabolic processes. The thyroid gland, located at the front of the neck, becomes excessively active, leading to symptoms such as rapid heart rate, weight loss, and nervousness. This condition predominantly affects women and can be triggered by factors like autoimmune diseases, particularly Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, and excessive iodine intake. The increase in thyroid hormones accelerates various bodily functions, causing patients to experience increased energy levels but also fatigue, heat intolerance, and sleep disturbances. You‚Äôll learn about lifestyle changes to support thyroid health through nutrition, mindfulness, and reducing toxins!

00:00 - What is Hyperthyroidism?
01:20 - How to track for symptoms and where to get help.
02:10 - What to remove from your home to avoid factors that negatively impact your hormones.
03:15 - Why you should track your symptoms and their severity.
04:20 - Why you should work with a health care practitioner.
05:30 - What are the mind/body practices that you can do for free?

Let‚Äôs talk about one of the most important nutrients for our health - vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Many people are deficient in this essential vitamin, and in this episode I break down how it acts more like a hormone than a vitamin. Vitamin D3 impacts so many systems in our body from brain and mood to immunity, heart health and more. I provided an overview of some of the key studies showing the links between vitamin D3 levels and diseases like cancer, diabetes, arthritis and neurological conditions. I even talk about seasonal affective disorder, my personal experience with it, and its link to low levels of vitamin D3. Tune in for my recommendations on getting your vitamin D3 levels optimized through supplementation.¬†

HIGHLIGHTS
0:00 Vitamin D's role in brain health and disease prevention.¬†
04:00 The science behind how vitamin D3 improves immune health.
06:30 Why do we associate getting sick in the winter and colder weather?
08:15 How does vitamin D3 benefit mood, weight loss, and overall health?
12:30 Vitamin D's role in heart health and supplementation.¬†

Today‚Äôs conversation will change your life, and could possibly even save your life. Gary and his wife Sage traveled to Long Island to interview their friend and amazing biologic dentist, Dr. Jigar Gandhi.¬†

So many people chalk up dental and health issues to aging when that just simply isn‚Äôt the case. Listen in as we educate about the link between periodontal disease, inflammation, gum disease, and all kinds of cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Gary and Dr. Gandhi talk about how the same bacteria that is found in gums and the jaw bone are found in the heart through the blood supply. As someone who is very woke to wellness himself, Gary shares his experience of getting dental work done with Dr. Gandhi and how he had no idea that issues going on in his mouth could be connected to symptoms in other parts of his body. Dr. Gandhi was able to pinpoint specific pain and issues in Gary‚Äôs left shoulder, lung, and toe that were linked to a tooth that needed to be removed.¬†

01:45 Biological dentistry and its connection to overall health.¬†
07:30 Gary‚Äôs dental issue that was causing symptoms in other parts of the body.
10:00 How is dental work linked to neurodegenerative disorders?
16:15 The importance of proper blood flow for dental procedures.
19:00 Finding the mystery cause of the issues Sage‚Äôs sister was having with her kidneys.
22:00 What inspired you to get into Biologic Dentistry?
24:15 The link between dental bacteria to metabolic syndrome.
26:15 What causes bacteria and parasites to pool in the jawline?
32:30 How to¬†detect if you have bacteria and parasites in your jaw from previous dental work.
34:15 What does it mean if a tooth is black?
40:30 Fluoride and its potential effects on health.¬†
43:40 Are ‚Äúsoft teeth‚Äù hereditary?
46:00 What is the pain level and healing like from getting biologic dentistry work done?
50:00 Oral health and detoxification.¬†

Let‚Äôs talk about one of most beneficial things you can do for a state of optimal health - grounding! So many people have accepted symptoms like brain fog or weight gain as part of aging when the cause isn‚Äôt aging at all.

In this episode, Gary shares the science behind how ‚Äúearthing‚Äù or grounding is the least you can do for your body and will result in the biggest benefits. If you go out and touch the surface of the earth for half the amount of time of this episode, you‚Äôre optimizing your health at the cellular level. Gary also shares the pulse electromagnetic field mat (aka PEMF Mat) which grounds the body and makes the blood alkaline. Tune in for the science on the one thing everyone needs to add to their routine to become the ultimate human.

In this short episode of The Ultimate Human, we‚Äôre going to discuss the intriguing relationship between depression and neurotransmitters. Discover how the brain creates emotional states through a specific combination of neurotransmitters, and how an imbalance in these crucial chemicals can affect our moods. Listen in as we unravel the complexities of depression, from its definition as an inadequate supply of serotonin to the limitations of SSRIs in effectively treating this mental health condition. We‚Äôll also uncover how certain nutrient deficiencies and overall gut health can impair our body's ability to synthesize serotonin, leading to anxiety and depression. We discuss the importance of supplementing with methylated nutrients and how genetic testing can help identify these deficiencies.¬†¬†

In today‚Äôs solo episode, Gary takes you through his career journey from assessing mortality risk for life insurance companies to starting a wellness franchise. He‚Äôll share his experiences applying his knowledge of biomarkers and genetics to treat patients by looking at the root causes of disease. He‚Äôll discuss his decades of research, striving to add not just years to your life but life to your years. He‚Äôll also explore the role of gene mutations and nutrient deficiencies, focusing on the MTHFR gene mutation that affects up to 44% of the population and the impact it has on our body's ability to convert folic acid into methylfolate. He discusses the wide range of issues a deficiency in methylation can lead to, including anxiety, depression, and poor gut health. Listen in as we unravel the effects of a gene mutation called COMT on conditions like high blood pressure, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia, and estrogen dominance. Learn how nutrient deficiencies can be the cause of common ailments, and how supplementing with the right nutrients can help restore things like estrogen balance.

Gary Brecka is a Human Biologist, biohacker, researcher, and an anti-aging and longevity expert. His approach to health is simple: "Aging is the aggressive pursuit of comfort.‚Äù

For over 20 years, he worked in the life insurance industry predicting mortality.

After years and years of doing this type of research and analysis, he decided he wanted to spend the balance of his lifetime helping people live happier, healthier, longer, more fulfilling lives.

With this mission in mind he created The Ultimate Human podcast. In this weekly podcast, Gary has exciting conversations with celebrities, athletes, entrepreneurs, and scientists and is thrilled to share their transformative insight with you.
