      <title>337. Trump Returns: What Now?</title>
      <description>Did Trump win it or did the Democrats blow it? What are the implications of a second Trump presidency for America and the rest of the world? Has rightwing populism delivered a fatal blow to liberal democracy?

Catchup on the last of our three special US election livestreams. Alastair is joined by Dominic Sandbrook from The Rest Is History, Marina Hyde from The Rest Is Entertainment, and Anthony Scaramucci from The Rest Is Politics US, to unpack Trump’s historic comeback victory and grapple with what it means for all of us. We also hear from political strategist, Peter Hyman, who predicted a Trump victory.

How do Rory and Alastair square their beliefs with what people want to hear? And, was Starmer right to suspend seven MPs over the two child benefit cap?

      <title>Introducing... The Rest Is Money</title>
      <description>Does money really make the world go round? Economics, business and finance have long been subjects we leave to the stockbrokers, hedge fund managers and business school professors who spend their lives obsessing over them - but there’s no reason we shouldn’t discuss ‘money’ in the same way we talk about sport and TV. 

In their new podcast, The Rest Is Money, business correspondent and broadcaster Steph McGovern is joined by old friend and economics expert Robert Peston to explore everything we need to know about the issues that affect us in our everyday lives: how will AI affect your job and our economic prospects? Are we stuck with higher inflation for years to come? Why are wealthy nations like Saudi Arabia buying up sport?

      <title>108. Hancock’s humiliation and the end for Johnson</title>
      <description>More than 100,000 WhatsApp messages have been leaked to the Daily Telegraph revealing private conversations between senior politicians and government officials during the height of the pandemic. But what do they tell us about the people leading our country, and how will Hancock recover from this? Rory and Alastair discuss this scandal, plus reflect on the news of Kier Starmer's new Chief of Staff appointment, the legacy of Live Aid in raising awareness of world poverty, and the new documentary about Shamima Begum and her battle for citizenship.

      <title>Leading: Michael Heseltine</title>
      <description>Rory and Alastair are launching a new podcast - 'Leading'!
  
Every Monday, Alastair and Rory are going to speak to people who are leading in their field. Whether they be presidents, policy makers, sports stars or religious leaders - Leading is going to be hosting the biggest names from many different walks of life.

Today's guest is former Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine. One of the biggest names in the last half-century of British politics, Lord Heseltine discusses everything from his crucial role in the rise and fall of Margaret Thatcher, to his current position in the House of Lords. 

Tune in to hear a preview from the pod...

Things get a little heated with a few polite disagreements later on, so if you want to hear the full interview, just search ‘LEADING’ wherever you get your podcasts, and subscribe to hear new episodes every Monday - or simply click on one of the links below:

      <title>60. Fear and Loathing in Birmingham</title>
      <description>Are we on the brink of Tory civil war? Has Truss painted herself into a corner with her conference speech? What on earth is an 'anti-growth coalition'?

Rory has scrambled Alastair for an emergency podcast to discuss growing unrest in Tory circles. Plus Labour's next moves, whether members should elect leaders, and OPEC's under-reported decision to cut 2 million barrels of oil per day in the middle of an energy crisis.

      <title>Introducing Empire</title>
      <description>Today's feed drop features historian and friend of the show William Dalrymple discussing our new sister podcast, Empire, which he hosts alongside broadcaster Anita Anand.

How do empires rise? Why do they fall? And how have they shaped the world around us today?

This new show explores the stories, personalities and events of empire over the course of history.

The first series looks at the British in India, covering The East India Company, the Raj, Gandhi, Independence and Partition.

In the opening episode, William and Anita discuss the rise of The East India Company, exploring how a small corporation with only a handful of employees came to rule India. The episode begins with the birth of the Company in Tudor England and culminates with Robert Clive and the Battle of Plassey.

      <title>15. Question Time: Hong Kong handover, human rights, and Tintin</title>
      <description>Welcome to the first ever episode of 'TRIP: Question Time'!

During our Question Time pods, Rory and Alastair will attempt to answer even more of the fantastic listener questions we get each week.

While the Wednesday pod will still dig into the main issues of the day, TRIP QT allows Alastair and Rory to debate wide-ranging topics and recount stories from their lives in politics and beyond.

This week the pod covers prisons, how to talk to totalitarian leaders about human rights, Alastair's memories of the Hong Kong handover, how Tintin inspired Rory, Alastair's most right wing view, Rory's most left wing view, and how your upbringing can shape your political outlook.

      <title>6. Globalism, Scottish Nationalism, and Rory's new job</title>
      <description>Could this be the final ever episode of The Rest Is Politics after Rory's revelation last Friday, 1st April? Hopefully not! After more terrible news from Ukraine and some countries refusing to shun Russia, could this crisis herald the end of a globalism? Also, reaction to populist leaders Orban and Le Pen gaining support in Europe, the ethics of working with questionable regimes, and what first attracted Rory Stewart to the Conservative Party?

      <title>The Rest Is History: Young Putin, the KGB and the Soviet Union</title>
      <description>In our most recent episode, Alastair mentioned our sister podcast, The Rest Is History, and its recent mini-series on the Soviet Union, its fall, Putin's early life and his subsequent rise to power.

Here's the first episode of the series on Brezhnev, Putin's formative years, his early KGB career and Gorbachev's descent into chaos.

Was Putin a nationalist or a communist? What changed from Brezhnev to Gorbachev? What was Putin doing in East Germany during the Soviet twilight years?

      <title>2. Lying, vanity and friendship in politics</title>
      <description>Welcome to the second episode of The Rest Is Politics with Rory Stewart and Alastair Campbell!

With Ukrainian refugees struggling to claim asylum in the UK, why aren't the British government's actions matching up to its rhetoric? Rory and Alastair discuss the importance of personal relationships in matters of state, and question whether the current honours system is fit for purpose after former education and defence secretary Gavin Williamson was given a knighthood.
