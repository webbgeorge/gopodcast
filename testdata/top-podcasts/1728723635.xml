      <title>Allison Holker Reveals All! Pt 1 Making Your Dreams Happen, Falling in Love with Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss &amp; Finding Hope after Heartbreak</title>
      <description>Are You Ready to believe in YOU?🙌 jamiekernlima.com 👈 Sign up for my FREE Inspirational Newsletter here and you’ll ALSO get special prompt questions to help you grow in your self-worth-building that pair with each episode!🩷

____

If you’re ready to be inspired to manifest your dreams and then make them happen, despite your setbacks or the circumstances you come from, Allison Holker shares her story of going from dance studio janitor to global dance superstar. We also dive deep into her whirlwind romance with fellow dancer Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss, and how after incomprehensible tragedy happened, Allison shares how she’s navigated and continues to navigate heartbreak while still maintaining hope, for herself and her family.
 
From So You Think You Can Dance, to Dancing with The Stars, Allison Holker is an Emmy-nominated choreographer, dancer, host, actor, and author. She first burst onto the scene when she competed in So You Think You Can Dance where she met fellow dancer, Stephen "tWitch" Boss, who she married in December of 2013. She and tWitch amassed millions of fans across the globe with their heart-warming spirits and inspiring dances. In 2022, tWitch sent shockwaves through the world, and through his family, when he took his own life, leaving behind his wife Allison and their three kids, and leaving millions of people asking “why” and “how could this have happened?” 
Today, Allison is sharing parts of her and their story, she’s never shared before, with the intention she says of inspiring and helping others. Allison shares she is also donating 100% of the proceeds from her brand new book called: “This Far - My Story of Love, Loss and Embracing the Light” to The Move with Kindness Foundation. 
It’s an honor to have these conversations and create a space for others to share their stories with you and me together. The intention of the show is to be a force for good and a force for love in the world, and my prayer is that this episode is both, for you, today.  
Note: If you or someone you know is struggling, please contact the Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, or text the word "STRENGTH" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org.
To receive 24/7 support from the National Sexual Assault Hotline, call 800-656-HOPE (4673). 
To report child sexual abuse or find resources for those in need of help, contact the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at 1-800-843-5678.

Do you ever feel like you’re not enough? And are you ready to change that? Today, I’m so excited to share with you what’s been a true revelation in my life…and what I’ve found to be one of the greatest keys to finally feeling fulfilled and enough! 
If you struggle with feeling enough, you’re far from alone! Statistics show that currently, 80% of women don’t believe they’re enough, 75% of female executives deal with impostor syndrome, 91% of girls and women don’t love their bodies, and 73% of men feel inadequate and not enough. And when we believe we’re not enough as who we innately are, it's a lie! A lie that can impact how we show up in every area of our lives from our jobs, to our most important relationships to our goals and hopes and dreams.

Today, I am so excited to share with you an exclusive chapter from my book WORTHY, just for you! It’s called The One Thing that Changes Everything. It’s about the difference between self-confidence and self-worth and how they both work in your life to finally help you overcome self-doubt and truly believe you are fully enough and fully worthy. Even if it’s for the first time ever, or for the first time in a long time! So get cozy and lean in, because I just feel in my heart that these words might be exactly for you today!

Faith leader, world changer and NYT bestselling author Sarah Jakes Roberts sells out stadiums and her words inspire people worldwide and she is here with this life-changing message for YOU today: “Your breath is a promise so Girl, Get Up.”
This is SUCH a powerful conversation and if you’re like me, you will feel your own shifts with every word!! Sarah shares her journey through the judgment of others when she became a very young mother, how that impacted her faith and self-worth, how she learned to trust the voice that calls you higher, how to protect the burning embers of your personal light, and how inauthenticity guarantees failure. It’s SO good!! The tools Sarah offers are a HUGE help to inform our choices – learn to cultivate “I’m enough” moments, to reclaim your power and to let God be the multiplier in your life.

Faith leader, world changer and NYT bestselling author Sarah Jakes Roberts sells out stadiums and her words inspire people worldwide and she is here with this life-changing message for YOU today: “Your breath is a promise so Girl, Get Up.”
This is SUCH a powerful conversation and if you’re like me, you will feel your own shifts with every word!! Sarah shares her journey through the judgment of others when she became a very young mother, how that impacted her faith and self-worth, how she learned to trust the voice that calls you higher, how to protect the burning embers of your personal light, and how inauthenticity guarantees failure. It’s SO good!! The tools Sarah offers are a HUGE help to inform our choices – learn to cultivate “I’m enough” moments, to reclaim your power and to let God be the multiplier in your life.

It’s Never Too Late…To Manifest Love, To Start a Family, To Launch the Business, To Write Your Book, Or to Live Your DREAMS! In this incredibly inspiring moving, and revealing conversation with icon Hoda Kotb, The Today Show co-anchor and Jamie go deep about overcoming rejection, riding the wave of life to new highs and new journeys, getting unstuck, the excitement of evolving into someone new, and how it’s truly never too late to live your best life!

Hoda dishes with Jamie on a recent “third date,” shares personal stories about the one “yes” that changed her life after 27 “no’s,” reveals tips for how to make space in your life for what you’re wanting to manifest into reality, and how it’s never too late to go for your dreams. Hoda and Jamie are tearful as Hoda shares her touching hopes for her two daughters, and “the signs” she see’s about expanding her family, now, at age 60!

I’m so excited to share with you a tool you can apply to your life right now that I’ve found to be truly life-changing! If you struggle with believing that you’re enough, if you tell yourself lies like if you’re the real you, people won’t like you as much, if you struggle with dimming your light, or maybe you hide parts of your authentic self and instead show up as your ‘representative” each day, because you think that’s the role you need to play to get approval at home, at work, in your friendships, your relationships or in your family…if you struggle with people pleasing…today’s episode is for you!!!!! 

I am also so excited to share an exclusive chapter from my book WORTHY, called You’re Not Crazy, You’re Just First, and I am so excited to share the lessons in this chapter, because when I started applying them to my life I felt lighter, worried less, and I embraced authenticity more. This one lesson has truly helped me step into alignment with my assignment! So get cozy and lean in, because I just feel in my heart that these words might be exactly what you need today! 

Also If you loved chapter 3 of WORTHY I can’t wait for you to get your hands on the entire book, there’s over 20 tools in it on how to build unshakable self-worth in your life right now! If you do pick up a copy of the book or audio book make sure you go to https://worthybook.com to get some amazing free gifts as a thank you from me to you!

Imagine. . .overcoming self-doubt, learning to believe in yourself and trust yourself and know you’re enough.

In this deeply personal episode, it’s YOU and ME, together! And if you’ve ever doubted you’re enough or wondered if your dreams are possible…then this episode is for you! 

I share the story, behind the story, of how I went from struggling waitress facing non-stop rejection, to building a billion-dollar business from my living room, and becoming a New York Times bestselling author, all by learning to believe in myself. And I’m obsessed with showing you how you can believe in yourself too, plus some of the tactical tools and lessons you can apply to your life right now! If self-doubt has already cost you too much in your life, it’s time to change that together!
