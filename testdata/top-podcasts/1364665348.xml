      <itunes:title>S26 E1: The Murder Video | &quot;The Outlaw Ocean&quot;</itunes:title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Crimes like this don&apos;t often happen on land. A 10-minute slow-motion slaughter captured by a cell phone camera shows a group of unarmed men at sea, possibly 15 of them, killed one by one by a semiautomatic weapon, after which the culprits pose for celebratory selfies. The shocking footage is then made public, and yet no government is willing to investigate, much less prosecute the murderers. This episode traces a tireless journalistic investigation of a shocking video that after 8 years, finally resulted in a 26-year conviction of the ship captain who ordered the cold-blooded killing. Looking for answers, this reporting takes us to the bizarre world of floating armories, which are part bunkhouse, part weapons depot, where maritime mercenaries wait for their next ship deployment. For broader context, the story explores the explosion of violence on the high seas, how Somali piracy is often used as a pretext for bloodletting by private security guards and the reasons that offshore crime often happens with impunity.

For broader context, the story explores the explosion of violence on the high seas, how Somali piracy is often used as a pretext for bloodletting by private security guards and the reasons that offshore crime often happens with impunity.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would be hard to believe if it hadn&apos;t actually happened. The longest law-enforcement chase in nautical history, spanning 110 days and 10,000 miles, featured a bunch of vigilantes pursuing Interpol&apos;s most wanted illegal fishing ship. Slaloming around icebergs in a deadly glacier field, cutting through a category 5 storm, this chase only ended when one of the ships sank. To discuss why illegal fishing is so rampant and unchecked, this episode takes us from the capture of the world&apos;s most notorious scofflaw vessel in African waters to the seas off the coast of North Korea, where we discover the planet&apos;s largest illegal fishing fleet.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ianâs account of his groundbreaking reporting on slavery in the South China Sea, the first time a reporter had ever made it onboard a Thai distant-water vessel using enslaved labour. Found shackled by the neck as part of the crew on a dilapidated fishing vessel, Lang Long was a victim of the nightmarish world of debt bondage. A global scourge, sea slavery is something most people do not realize exists. This episode explains how it happens, taking us for the first time on board one such roach and rat-infested ship on the South China Sea, worked by 40 Cambodian boys. The episode also explains how overfishing has given rise to trans-shipment, fish-laundering and a prevalence of abuse that companies and governments have a tough time countering or tracking.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The sea has always been a metaphor for freedom â an escape from governments, laws and other people. This episode takes us off the coast of England to Sealand. A rogue âmicronationâ meant to embody this very freedom, which was founded on an abandoned British anti-aircraft platform in 1967. âFrom the Sea, Freedomâ explores the world of libertarian-minded endeavors at sea, where renegades and mavericks of all sorts seek to escape the laws of land-bound nation-states. The reporting also visits the high seas near Mexico to meet other characters who leverage the freedom and a legal gray area found offshore. We travel with Rebecca Gomperts, the founder of Women on Waves, a group that provides abortion access for women who live in countries where it is restricted. Secretly carrying several Mexican women beyond national waters, Rebecca uses a loophole in maritime law to legally administer pills that will end their pregnancies.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The oceans are running out of fish. To slow down that problem, environmentalists pushed for fish farming or aquaculture. The problem is this industry became too big and too hungry. To fatten the farmed fish faster, they started feeding the high-protein pellets called fishmeal â made from massive amounts of fish caught at sea. Now, more than 30 percent of all marine life pulled from the sea feeds other fish in aquaculture farms inland. To explore this upside-down situation, we travel to the West African country of The Gambia for an offshore patrol where hundreds of Chinese and other fishing boats trawl for fishmeal production, cratering the local food source and polluting the coastline.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a ship inadvertently spills oil, itâs big news. But every three years, ships intentionally dump more oil than the Exxon Valdez, and BP spills combined. This episode highlights a vexing and woefully under-discussed problem. It is made possible by corrupt ship captains who use a so-called âMagic Pipeâ that dumps oil discreetly under the water line rather than disposing of it on land as legally required. To learn about this problem, the episode tells the story of Carnivalâs Caribbean Princess cruise ship, which used such a pipe and was caught, convicted and hit with the biggest fine in history. This case is set in a broader context of other forms of at-sea dumping, such as plastic pollution, and highlights how the sea has long â and perilously â been viewed as a bottomless trash can.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;High Seas. High Stakes. High Crimes. There are few remaining frontiers on our planet. Perhaps the wildest, and least understood, are the worldâs oceans: too big to police, and under no clear international authority, these immense regions of treacherous water play host to rampant criminality and exploitation. The Outlaw Ocean is a 7-part series that explores a gritty and lawless realm rarely seen, populated by traffickers and smugglers, pirates and mercenaries, wreck thieves and repo men, vigilante conservationists and elusive poachers, seabound abortion providers, clandestine oil dumpers, shackled slaves and cast-adrift stowaways. Hosted by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ian Urbina, the series relies on more than 8 years of reporting at sea on all 7 oceans and more than 3 dozen countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To hear all episodes of The Outlaw Ocean now, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.chtbl.com/qqiXFgCh&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tracking down scammers â how and why do they do it? One tells host Hannah Ajala: âI always feel badâ.

      <description>From the BBC World Service and CBC Podcasts comes Hollywood Exiles. Host Oona Chaplin tells the story of the decades-long campaign to root out communism in Hollywood. Itâs a campaign that eventually drove her grandfather, Charlie Chaplin, and many others out of tinseltown. Hollywood Exiles is a tale of glamour, duplicity and political intrigue that reverberates to this day. Itâs the story of how Tinseltown became an ideological battleground. The toll of the fight was enormous â reputations, careers and families were torn apart by the campaign to drive communists from the movie business.

      <description>One July night in 1995, Deputy Sheriff William G. Hardy was shot behind the Crown Sterling Suites hotel in Birmingham, Alabama. At the same time as the murder, at least ten people saw Toforest Johnson four miles away, at a popular nightclub called Tee&apos;s Place. But detectives zeroed in on him as a main suspect in Deputy Hardyâs murder anyway, ultimately resulting in Toforest being tried, convicted, and sentenced to death. For over a quarter century, Toforest has been confined to a 5â by 8â cell on Alabamaâs death row. In 2019, investigative journalist Beth Shelburne began covering the case, going down a disturbing rabbit hole revealing many unsettling facts that cast grave doubts about Toforestâs guilt. The facts she found tear at the very foundation of the American criminal justice system: No eyewitnesses or physical evidence tied Toforest to the murder; the state tried to convict a different man for the same crime; and perhaps most disturbing of all, Toforestâs conviction relied on an âearwitnessâ â a woman who claimed to have eavesdropped on an incriminating phone call, a woman whom prosecutors paid for her testimony, in secret. That payment was not disclosed to the jury, Toforest, or his lawyers until after he had been on death row for 17 years. From the team behind the award-winning hit podcast Bone Valley, Lava for Goodâs Earwitness is an 8-episode docuseries that asks the question, âHow did an innocent man end up on death row â and why is the state still trying to execute him over the objection of the prosecutor who put him there?â Shelburneâs unprecedented access to key playersâthe lead detective, lead prosecutor, witnesses, jurors, and the earwitness herselfâ illuminate a story filled with disturbing twists, frustrating ambiguities, and shocking admissions. The story of Toforest Johnson and the state&apos;s enthusiasm for the death penalty in the face of such troubling evidentiary flaws brings to light the failings of a criminal justice system run amok. Earwitness is a production of Lava for Good Podcasts in association with Signal Co. No1.</description>

Host Kathleen Goldhar goes on a byzantine journey to find out what kind of life do you have to live that your death spurns on multiple theories about who might have killed you, including some involving your closest family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transcripts of this series, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/the-no-good-terribly-kind-wonderful-lives-and-tragic-deaths-of-barry-and-honey-sherman-transcripts-listen-1.6793254&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leosewell.net/ &quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leo Sewellâs website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Campbellâs &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2018-apotex-billionaire-murder/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Unsolved Murder of an Unusual Billionaire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0007210/ &quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saul Rubinekâs IMDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Shermansâ funeral is weird, the list of eulogists long, and itâs attended by Canadian boldface names. But ask anyone who knew Barry Sherman and they all say the same thing:he was the smartest person they&apos;d ever met. Always finishing at the top of his class, Barry was smart enough to claw his way to the top of the infamously cutthroat generic drug industry and make billions of dollars. But he was also arrogant and unreasonable, driven and deceptive.

The Winter cousins were close to Barry â especially Kerry. They were father/son close. And the Winter boys lived well off Barry&apos;s money.

They arenât talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transcripts of this series, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/the-no-good-terribly-kind-wonderful-lives-and-tragic-deaths-of-barry-and-honey-sherman-transcripts-listen-1.6793254&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemarysexton.com/ &quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rosemary Sextonâs website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</itunes:summary>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a notorious 2018 interview on CBC television, Kerry Winter became a familiar figure in the tale of the Shermansâ deaths. âThe Cousin Did Itâ wasnât just a snappy headline on the cover of The National Enquirer, it also became a favourite theory. Yet Kerry is not a suspect. And all these years later the humiliation, anger, and deep sadness Kerry feels towards his cousin Barry are still right on the surface. How did such a good thing go so bad, and why is Kerry so certain Barry killed Honey then killed himself? Was a man capable of âripping off little orphansâ also capable of killing his own wife? And himself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov7SCivAo5A&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kerry Winter on The Fifth Estate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For transcripts of this series, please visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbc.ca/radio/podcastnews/the-no-good-terribly-kind-wonderful-lives-and-tragic-deaths-of-barry-and-honey-sherman-transcripts-listen-1.6793254&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After our year-long investigation, in this final episode we revisit the murder/suicide theory. That misstep set the whole investigation off on the wrong foot, and might have derailed any chance of finding out who killed the Shermans. To the Sherman&apos;s children, it&apos;s one of the biggest police screw-ups in recent history â a botched job that muddled the truth and stained the family. But the theory hangs in the air because its adherents, especially Kerry Winter, arenât budging. In the end, what is the Shermansâ legacy?

      <itunes:title>Introducing: The Africas VS. America</itunes:title>
      <description>To those that remember, itâs known simply as the bombing of West Philly. In the spring of 1985, the City of Philadelphia became the first in U.S. history to drop a bomb on a family of American citizens. The attack killed 11 people, including five children, and the ensuing fire set a neighborhood to ruins. The targets that day? A family of Black radicals known collectively as MOVE, who found themselves ensnared in a city â and nationâs â domestic war on Black Liberation. Over seven episodes, host Matthew Amha investigates the events that culminated in the MOVE bombing, and the long afterlife of a forgotten American tragedy. Through intimate conversations, The Africas VS. America offers an unseen look into the MOVE&apos;s origins and dynamics while looking ahead to the group&apos;s uncertain future.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the early hours of May 13, 1985, police direct residents of Osage Avenue in West Philadelphia to leave their homes, and not return for 24 hours. Itâs Motherâs Day, and authorities have come to resolve a years-long conflict with a family of local revolutionaries â the Africas, collectively known as MOVE. There are 13 people in the Africa home that morning. Six of them are children. By the end of the day, most will be dead, and a neighbourhood will lie in ruins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Africas VS.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1983, the City of Philadelphia elects its first Black mayor as successor to Frank Rizzo. Woodrow Wilson Goode inherits Rizzoâs fight against MOVE, but he also represents a moment of hope for Black Philadelphians who believe his election could be a harbinger of progress for a city beset with racial strife. Instead, Mayor Goodeâs administration unleashes a torrent of violence never before seen in American history in an effort to neutralize MOVE once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Africas VS.

      <description>Richard Thomas was smart, kind and well-loved. He was having no problems in school and he wanted to go further in education. Then inexplicably, days before his graduation, heâs found dead in the Kuper Island school gym. His death was ruled a suicide â with no further questions as to why. We piece together a portrait of the teenager through his own writings, and find an old coronerâs report that raises more questions than answers about how Thomas died.

      <description>The team tracks down the last person to ever see Richard Thomas alive at Kuper Island Residential School. Donnie Sampson was just 10 years old at the time and has disturbing memories of the day â that include a familiar and problematic name from the past. Host Duncan McCue takes the results of the investigation back to Richardâs sister Belvie who must decide what to do next. In Penelakut, the community rallies around their children â the new generation, the adult survivors still healing, and all the ones who never came home.

      <description>The world would not be talking about âPeter Nygard, the predatorâ if it werenât for a group of ten 
mostly Bahamian girls and young women who accused the fashion mogul of raping them. 
Two original âJane Doesâ tell their stories. They say, in their early teens, they were lured with false promises to Nygardâs palatial estate in the Bahamas, and attacked. 
We also learn about the so-called âpamper partiesâ: events thrown by Nygard made to sound luxurious and fun ... but whose purpose was far more sinister. This is Uncover: Evil By Design.

      <description>This is Uncover: Brainwashed. The Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal was an innovative new hospital where patients sought cutting-edge psychiatric care. But instead of being helped, many were subjected to shockingly brutal experiments: massive doses of LSD or other drugs, electroshocks, and sensory deprivation. How â and why â could this be allowed to happen?

      <description>MKULTRA was supposed to have ended in the 1960s. The torturous experiments didnât work. So why did these techniques evolve and continue to be used by American trainers throughout Latin America, and then get revived once again in the era that followed the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks? The CIAâs Black Sites and a courtroom inside the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base may hold some of the answers. This is Uncover: Brainwashed.

      <description>MKULTRA has entered popular culture, becoming the butt of jokes, television plot points, and the darling of internet conspiracy theorists. At the very least, the secrecy that still surrounds MKULTRA, or the CIAâs post-9/11 programs, sows distrust of governments, and medical professionals. At worst, it gives credence to online conspiracies, like Pizzagate, that end up having real world consequences. Meanwhile, the families of the victims continue to suffer. And continue to fight for justice and recognition. This is Uncover: Brainwashed.

By the early 90s, the panic reached the tiny Prairie town of Martensville, Saskatchewan. And nearly 30 years later, the people touched by it all are still picking up the pieces. So what happened? And why do so many still believe to this day?</description>
