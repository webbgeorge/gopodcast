But plough on past Brian Lara we will. And welcome new listeners for 2025. The BBC's wide reaching podcast ad campaign has no doubt brought you here. You are likely puzzled now that you're here, because what follows today is a man spending around 35 minutes ranting about speakers and the technicalities of streaming platforms, before another 35 of a man talking about knowing people in Wales.</p><p>It’s all completely approachable stuff. Debates have rarely been more heated as John has a massive bee in his big old billy bonnet about the adjustability and accessibility of modern tech. He’s been on the forums. Dave, Elis and likely most of the audience meanwhile just don’t get his problem. It’s not The Dance but has similar levels of intensity.</p><p>And in an episode of intense chats Dave finally snaps as he’s pushed to his limits by criticism following the sun lounger controversy. But fear not, because it's an impact moment.

Plus there are some bold assertions thrown around in the current operating house of this nation, the Petty Parliament.</p><p>If you want to get in touch with the show with everything from your Mad Dads to general entertaining musings then fire it across to elisandjohn@bbc.co.uk.

No, they aren’t heading to a couples retreat in Bali to “find themselves”; Elis is going on a stag do and John is off to play golf. So, like the dedicated broadcasters they are, the guys reconvened on a crisp Sunday morning to ensure that no one has to go a week without their usual fix of affable broadcasting.</p><p>As well as all the usual fun there was a calamitous performance in a Made Up Game, Elis tells a joke so poor that it wouldn’t make it into a Christmas cracker, John shares his unusual phobia, and Producer Dave gets a lesson in moth-edible clothing.</p><p>As a side note, we recorded this episode before the recent political events regarding the Prime Minister. We can assure you that as capable broadcasters Elis and John are more than trusted to cover political goings-on; they just don't yet have the ability to see into the future.</p>]]></itunes:summary><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><itunes:duration>6253</itunes:duration><enclosure url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download-rss/proto/http/vpid/p0d8cyz0.mp3" length="100048000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureLegacy url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download-rss/proto/http/vpid/p0d8cyz0.mp3" length="100048000" type="audio/mpeg"/><ppg:enclosureSecure url="https://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download-rss/proto/https/vpid/p0d8cyz0.mp3" length="100048000" type="audio/mpeg"/><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:bbc:podcast:p0d8dhyd</guid><link>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0d8dhyd</link><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><media:content url="http://open.live.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/6/redir/version/2.0/mediaset/audio-nondrm-download-rss/proto/http/vpid/p0d8cyz0.mp3" fileSize="100048000" type="audio/mpeg" medium="audio" expression="full" duration="6253"/><itunes:author>BBC Radio 5 Live</itunes:author><ppg:canonical>/programmes/p0d8dhyd</ppg:canonical></item><item><title>#240 - Café del Marsterman, Lonely Fans and Weymouth Whining</title><description><![CDATA[<p>Due to #factors Elis and John didn’t present a live show today; but not ones to let you, the listener, miss out on their weekly dose of chat they decided to record a bonus episode.
