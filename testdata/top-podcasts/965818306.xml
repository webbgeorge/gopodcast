    <description>“48 Hours” uncovers the narrative behind crime and justice cases that have left a lasting mark on society. Award-winning CBS News correspondents thoughtfully examine the complexities of each crime by transporting you to the heart of the investigation through key evidence and gripping interviews with critical figures from the case. The unmatched reporting has made a tangible difference in countless lives, leading to the exoneration of wrongly convicted individuals and the reopening — and resolution — of previously closed cold cases.
Listen to a new “48 Hours” episode every Monday and then go deeper into the case on Tuesdays with the immersive “Post Mortem” series — producers and correspondents join host Anne-Marie Green to discuss key evidence, dead ends, mishaps, and stranger-than-fiction twists they faced in the field. Plus, every Thursday, we’ll revisit a classic “48 Hours” episode.

Circumstantial evidence, including an airline ticket, two wigs and gas purchased in the area, all with a credit card in the name of Piper’s former boyfriend, indicated to investigators that Piper plotted to kill her husband using her sister's identity. “48 Hours" correspondent Harold Dow reports.

      <title>With God as a Witness</title>
      <description>In November of 1994, Farah Fratta was discovered dead in the garage of her Texas home. She had been shot twice in the head. At the time, Farah was in the midst of a divorce with her husband, Bob Fratta. Bob was an upstanding citizen, who worked in public safety as both a police officer and a fireman. But divorce documents were about to make his dark side public. To investigators, Bob was the likeliest suspect in his wife’s murder, but he had a seemingly airtight alibi: he was at church with their three children at the time of Farah's death. “48 Hours" correspondent Richard Schlesinger reports. This classic "48 Hours" episode last aired on 02/05/2011. Watch all-new episodes of “48 Hours” on Saturdays, and stream on demand on Paramount+.

      <title>Marriage Secrets</title>
      <description>In December of 2007, Jocelyn Earnest was found dead from a gunshot wound in her Virginia home. Beside her was a revolver and a suicide note. But investigators believed that the scene was staged and found fingerprints on the note that matched her estranged husband, Wesley Earnest. Amidst a divorce, it was the lake house they fought over: Jocelyn wanted it sold and Earnest didn’t want to let it go. Investigators charged Wesley for murder, and then fifteen months after the death, another bizarre twist: the lake house burned down while Wesley was out on bond awaiting trial. “48 Hours" correspondent Tracy Smith reports.

      <title>She Knew Too Much</title>
      <description>In 1992, 19-year-old Mischelle Lawless' bloodied body was found in an abandoned car on a desolate strip of highway in Benton, Missouri. Four months into the investigation, investigators got a break: 17-year-old Joshua Kezer had been held briefly in the county jail on assault charges, where, according to several inmates, he confessed to killing Lawless. Kezer was convicted and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Sheriff Rick Walter re-opened the case in 2005. Judge Richard Callahan agreed to review the case and, citing prosecutorial misconduct and a lack of evidence, declared Josh Kezer an innocent man. But someone killed Mischelle and high on the list of suspects is a local man, Mark Abbott, who was once a star witness for the prosecution.  “48 Hours" correspondent Erin Moriarty reports. This classic "48 Hours" episode last aired on 7/21/2012. Watch all-new episodes of “48 Hours” on Saturdays, and stream on demand on Paramount+.

      <title>The Money Trail</title>
      <description>In November 2000, bank manager and single mother Michelle Renee was in her Vista, California, home with her seven-year-old daughter Breea, when three masked gunmen broke into the house.  The gunmen held them captive overnight, and in the morning strapped dynamite onto their backs.  Breea was shoved into a closet, while Michelle was ordered to rob the bank where she worked. She obeyed, and the next morning she cleaned out the bank vault and gave the gunmen a duffel bag containing $360,000. Police and FBI investigation soon apprehended four suspects: Christopher Butler, Lisa Ramirez, Christopher Huggins, and Robert Ortiz.  “48 Hours" correspondent Susan Spencer reports. This classic "48 Hours" episode last aired on 7/23/2010. Watch all-new episodes of “48 Hours” on Saturdays, and stream on demand on Paramount+.

      <title>Post Mortem | Tracking the Killer of Mary Catherine Edwards</title>
      <description>Correspondent Natalie Morales and Producers Jenna Jackson and Mary Murphy examine the DNA technology that cracked the cold case of Mary Catherine Edwards’ murder. They discuss a detective and genetic genealogist who sifted through nearly 7,500 names on a family tree to identify a single killer, Clayton Foreman, and how police and a Texas Ranger arrested him. They also discuss how the Smith &amp; Wesson handcuffs used to bind Mary Catherine came full circle and the revelation that she had been a bridesmaid at the Foremans’ wedding.

      <title>Out of the Shadows</title>
      <description>When Vicki Wegerle, the mother of two young children, was strangled in Wichita, Kansas, in 1986, her husband Bill was considered by many to be the prime suspect. For the next 18 years, police lacked evidence to charge Bill, or anyone else with Vicki’s murder. Subsequently, a desire for recognition led Dennis Rader, aka the BTK (bind, torture, kill) killer, to fall into a police trap and supply them with incriminating evidence. This classic "48 Hours" episode last aired on 10/1/2005. Watch all-new episodes of “48 Hours” on Saturdays, and stream on demand on Paramount+.

      <description>An updated report on the murder trial of Frederick Mueller, who was charged with the 2008 murder of his wife, Dr. Leslie Mueller. She was killed while the two were out for a walk near their vacation home in Lake City, Colorado.

      <description>On September 24, 1988, Brenda Sue Schaefer was sexually tortured and murdered in Louisville, Kentucky. Brenda’s boyfriend Mel Ignatow was tried for the crime. Despite the testimony of his ex-girlfriend Mary Ann Shore, who led police to the spot where Brenda Sue’s body was buried, jurors found Ignatow not guilty for lack of evidence. However, six months later new incriminating evidence — Brenda’s jewelry and photos from the night of her murder — were discovered in Ignatow’s former home.

      <title>In Too Deep</title>
      <description>A further examination of the story of Laura Hall, who was convicted and sent to prison for the crime of dismembering the body of Jennifer Cave in 2005.

Put on trial for this crime, and for helping Pitonyak escape, she was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison. However, after 17 months in jail, Laura Hall was released. Her conviction was upheld and she was out on bond while prosecutors fought to put her back in jail. Pitonyak’s new lawyer said that they had new evidence and that Hall was also responsible for the murder, which she denies. “48 Hours" correspondent Maureen Maher reports.

Lesa's boyfriend, Dr. Christ Koulis, told police they had spent most of the weekend in her bedroom having sex. Koulis, a plastic surgeon, had called 911 when she stopped breathing, and said he performed CPR, but that there was no pulse. At her apartment, detectives discovered used syringes with traces of oxycodone, a powerful narcotic available only from a prescribing physician. “48 Hours" correspondent Troy Roberts reports. This classic "48 Hours" episode last aired on 8/21/2010. Watch all-new episodes of “48 Hours” on Saturdays, and stream on demand on Paramount+.

      <title>One of Their Own</title>
      <description>In 1986, Sherri Mae Rasmussen was attacked, beaten and shot to death in her Los Angeles home.

For more than two decades, Nels tried to get the police to focus on John’s ex-girlfriend, Stephanie Lazarus, a decorated Los Angeles police detective. Detectives trailed Lazarus to obtain a DNA sample and the results were stunning: the DNA from Sherri’s bite mark and that of Stephanie Lazarus matched.  “48 Hours" correspondent Maureen Maher reports.

      <title>Daddy's Girl</title>
      <description>On July 19, 2007, Timothy MacNeil, a prominent defense attorney, was shot to death in his San Diego home. The only witness was his 17-year-old stepdaughter, Brae Hansen, who was found tied up at the scene. She told police that a masked gunman had broken in and committed the murder but had left her alive. Further police interrogation of Hansen led to her arrest as a suspect, and she later implicated her brother, Nathan Gann, in the murder. “48 Hours" correspondent Tracy Smith reports.

      <title>Toe on the Trigger | Blood is Thicker: The Hargan Family Killings | Part 5</title>
      <description>Detectives finally arrest a suspect in the Hargan family murders. But at trial, defense attorneys present a new theory for how the killings might have happened. According to one scenario based on a forensic specialist's digitally reconstructed crime scene, Helen could have reached the rifle trigger with her toe. And that theory might cast enough doubt to throw the entire case into question.

      <title>A Case For Murder</title>
      <description>On June 2, 2007, the body of 36-year-old Hugues de la Plaza was found in his locked San Francisco apartment. He had been stabbed in the neck, chest and stomach. His apartment was covered in blood, and the scene seemed to have all the characteristics of a homicide, but there was no sign of a struggle, no sign of anyone else’s DNA at the scene, and no image of an assailant on nearby security cameras. “48 Hours" correspondent Maureen Maher reports.

      <title>The Impersonator | Blood is Thicker: The Hargan Family Killings | Part 4</title>
      <description>Investigators think they know who killed the Hargan women, but can't seem to get a confession. Then, a representative from Capital One bank sent them recordings of some strange phone calls made the day before the shootings. Someone pretending to be Pamela Hargan called the bank wanting a wire transfer for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Those recordings would expose a motive. Armed with phone records and documents, detectives are ready to indict their suspect.

      <title>A Killer in Plain Sight | Blood is Thicker: The Hargan Family Killings | Part 3</title>
      <description>When detectives started investigating the deaths of Helen and Pamela Hargan, they came to a much different conclusion than the first responders on the scene. With newfound evidence surrounding the rifle at the scene, Helen and Pamela's cell phones, and Carlos Gutierrez's call to 911, detectives realized this was not a murder-suicide; it was a double homicide. But who could have killed the mother and daughter? Police began to zoom in on a single, shocking suspect.

      <title>The Boyfriend | Blood is Thicker: The Hargan Family Killings | Part 2</title>
      <description>On the day that Helen Hargan and her mother Pamela were found dead, Helen Hargan's boyfriend Carlos spent hours convincing 911 dispatchers to send help to the Hargan house. By the time police arrived, it was too late. Police were given two versions of the morning: one where Helen was scared for her life, and one where she was likely the killer. But Carlos' story, along with the weapon placement at the crime scene, would blow a hole in the theory that the Hargan killings were a murder-suicide.

From the outside, the Hargan women had it all. But even though there was love, there were also grievances. When Pamela and Helen were found dead in an apparent murder-suicide, detectives had to ask: what was going on inside the Hargan household?

      <title>Murder on his Mind</title>
      <description>In April 2005, Stephen Stanko murdered his girlfriend Laura Ling, and then raped and stabbed her daughter. Shortly afterwards, he killed a friend, Henry Turner. At his trial for Laura's murder, Stephen's lawyer called on medical experts who claimed that PET scan images of his brain revealed that he was born with a brain defect that made him psychopathic and, on occasion, temporarily insane. “48 Hours" correspondent Troy Roberts reports. This classic "48 Hours" episode last aired on 9/1/2007. Watch all-new episodes of “48 Hours” on Saturdays, and stream on demand on Paramount+.

      <title>Everything to Lose</title>
      <description>Dana Clair Edwards was found dead in her home in San Antonio, Texas on January 2, 2009. She was last seen alive leaving a New Year’s Eve party just after midnight. Police interviewed friends and acquaintances, including Dana’s ex-boyfriend, John Thomas Ford.

      <title>Post Mortem | The Hunt for Sarah Yarborough’s Killer</title>

Correspondent Natalie Morales along with producers Chris Young Ritzen and Lauren Clark discuss how a man who’d been in and out of prison for crimes against women was able to slip through the cracks for decades, and that forensic genetic genealogy ultimately connected him to Sarah’s murder.

      <title>Post Mortem | The Strange Death of Professor Shockley</title>
      <description>In 2019, college professor and renowned entomologist, Marianne Shockley, was found unresponsive in a hot tub after a night of partying. Georgia police were called to the scene for an alleged drowning, but when they arrived they found Shockley covered in blood. Something wasn’t adding up, and the last two people to see her alive – her boyfriend, Marcus Lillard, and their friend, Clark Heindel – told investigators conflicting accounts of what happened that night. Correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti and Producer Paul La Rosa discuss whether her death was an accident or if there could’ve been a motive for murder.

      <title>Post Mortem | The Death of an Officer's Wife</title>
      <description>From the outside, Amanda Perrault and her husband Seth, a police officer, seemed like a picture-perfect family. They had a beautiful home in Georgia and were raising a young daughter together. But behind closed doors, Amanda alleged she saw a different, and abusive, side of Seth. What happens when a toxic relationship turns deadly, especially at the hands of someone who is supposed to serve and protect? Correspondent Anne-Marie Green and Producer Judy Rybak discuss crossing the thin blue line, a questionable note left behind at the crime scene, the shocking report from the medical examiner ruling Amanda’s death a suicide and if this would be enough to find Seth innocent at trial.

      <title>Soccer Moms Confidential</title>
      <description>This classic episode of “48 Hours" explores the investigation of ex-cop turned private eye Chris Butler who staffed his San Francisco Bay area firm with local soccer moms. Butler and his firm of private investigator moms became media sensations — Lifetime Television started a reality show based on the P.I. moms. Reporter Pete Crooks was invited to write about the real-life “Charlie’s Angels,” but the story took a strange turn when he learned from a confidential informant that most of the cases were staged, crooked cops were involved, and that Butler was dealing drugs with top California narcotics cop Norm Wielsch. Butler and Wielsch were also running a massage parlor which was allegedly a front for prostitution. The soccer moms were unaware of Butler and Wielsch’s alleged schemes. Butler was sentenced to eight years in prison and was released in 2019. In 2013, Norm Wielsch was sentenced to 14 years in prison. “48 Hours” correspondent Maureen Maher reports.  This "48 Hours" episode last aired on 11/17/12. Watch all-new episodes of “48 Hours” on Saturdays, and stream on demand on Paramount+.

      <title>No Way Out</title>
      <description>This classic episode of 48 Hours, which last aired on 7/5/2008, explores a tragedy in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. After Hurricane Katrina had passed over southeastern Louisiana, many people thought the region had been spared from the most severe damage. But the worst was yet to come: on Monday, August 29th 2005, the region's protective levees started to fail, and entire communities were overwhelmed by floodwater. Could the operators of St. Rita's Nursing Home, Sal and Mabel Magano, be held responsible after 35 people in their care die? "48 Hours" correspondent Harold Dow reports.

      <title>Investigation of the Gilgo Beach Murders</title>
      <description>On the evening of July 13, 2023, New York, authorities took into custody Rex Heuermann of Massapequa, Long Island. The architect was arrested in connection with what has been called the Long Island Serial killer case. Since late 2010, the remains of at least 10 people have been found on Gilgo Beach. The investigation first began when a young woman by the name of Shannan Gilbert disappeared. While investigators were searching for Gilbert, they found the other remains. Gilbert’s body was finally found a year later, but police ruled her death an accident and determined it was not a result of a crime.
Erin Moriarty has been covering this story since 2011. This “48 Hours” episode aired on Dec. 12, 2020.

      <title>Written in Blood</title>
      <description>This classic episode of 48 Hours, which last aired on 9/25/2004, tells the story of two boys who write a screenplay involving murder, but is it fiction or a confession? The 1994 murders of the Rafay family — Sultana Rafay, her husband Tariq, and their autistic daughter, Basma — focused on the pursuit and arrest of the two primary suspects: Atif Rafay, the only surviving family member, and his friend Sebastian Burns, who took refuge in Canada and had written the script for a film called “The Great Despisers,” whose plot paralleled the 1994 murders. 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant reports.

The 1994 murders of the Rafay family — Sultana Rafay, her husband Tariq, and their autistic daughter, Basma — focused on the pursuit and arrest of the two primary suspects: Atif Rafay, the only surviving family member, and his friend Sebastian Burns, who took refuge in Canada and had written the script for a film called “The Great Despisers,” whose plot paralleled the 1994 murders. 48 Hours correspondent Peter Van Sant reports.

      <title>Introducing Raynella Leath | Married to Death from My Life of Crime with Erin Moriarty</title>
      <description>The trial of Raynella Leath is unlike anything Erin Moriarty has covered before. It all began in 2003 with a frantic call to 911 when Raynella said she found her second husband David Leath dead of a single gunshot wound and called 911 to report it as a suicide. However, his autopsy said otherwise, and 14 years later, Raynella stood in court on trial for his murder. Hear the beginning of Raynella Leath’s story and how the widow’s web begins to unravel. This is the first episode of Married to Death from My Life of Crime with Erin Moriarty, available on Amazon Music or wherever you get your podcasts. New episodes on Wednesdays.

      <title>A Broken Heart: What Killed Lina Kaufman? | My Life of Crime</title>
      <description>On November 7th, 2007, 33-year-old Lina Kaufman was found dead in her Florida home on the bathroom floor. Her husband, Adam Kaufman, called 911 while trying to revive her. Seventeen months passed with no answers for the cause of her death, until Adam was suddenly arrested and charged with second-degree murder. At first, medical experts pointed to physical evidence of strangulation, while Adam’s defense attorneys speculated about an allergic reaction to a spray tan. Yet unbeknownst to either side, the truth was hidden much deeper than they could see initially. 48 Hours correspondent Erin Moriarty takes you inside the investigation of Adam Kaufman on her podcast, My Life of Crime. Based on the 48 Hours investigation, “Lina’s Heart”.

      <title>The Long Con: Clark Rockefeller Part 2 | My Life of Crime</title>
      <description>In 2008, a man masquerading as a member of the New York Rockefellers was unmasked as a German man named Christian Gerhartsreiter. In Part 2 of “The Long Con”, he goes on trial for the murder of his former neighbor John Sohus, but the prosecution has little to no direct evidence implicating him. They also lack an obvious motive. Why would a conman like Gerhartsreiter commit murder and risk blowing his own cover? And after the trial, Erin Moriarty sits down with Gerhartsreiter to continue exploring the question behind it all: Who was Clark Rockefeller, really? 48 Hours correspondent Erin Moriarty takes you inside the investigation of “Clark Rockefeller” on her podcast, My Life of Crime. Based on the 48 Hours investigation, “aka Rockefeller”.

When she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41.” Despite what everyone thinks they know, there is a stunning verdict in the case. In part 1 of this unusual road trip, Erin takes us to the scene of the crime - the house where the murders took place is now The Lizzie Borden Bed and Breakfast/Museum. We learn about the Borden family and what happened on that fateful day in August of 1892. It was a brutal crime scene and there are actual death photos hanging in the house. Erin will spend the night here. She is looking for a motive, evidence and maybe a ghost or two.
