						<description><![CDATA[<p>Jason Derulo is a force of nature: a global hitmaker who’s sold over 250 million singles and been writing songs since the age of 8.

And finally, I reflect on my deep desire to be liked and that need to be remembered, rather than forgotten, which has motivated me to keep pushing forward.</p><br><p>This episode was a bit out of my comfort zone but it’s a reminder that sometimes, you just have to dive in and see where it takes you.</p><br><p>And thank you for listening to the show - whether you've been here from the beginning or it's a recent find, I really appreciate every single listen so thank you!

						<description><![CDATA[<p>Shirley Ballas is a powerhouse: she’s the only woman in history to win the British Open to the World Professional Latin Championships with two different partners, reaching the final an incredible 17 times, and now the head judge on Strictly Come Dancing. I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know Shirley during my time on Strictly, and I’ve always been struck by how truly fascinating her story is so I’m so pleased to have her on the show this week…</p><br><p>Shirley’s journey began on a housing estate in Northern England, where she grew up with her single mother and older brother, learning resilience early. By seven, she was traveling hours by bus and train to pursue her passion, supported by her hardworking mother, who remains her greatest inspiration. Along the way, Shirley has faced heartbreak, losing her brother to suicide—a tragedy that fuels her advocacy for mental health charities like CALM. She’s also navigated the complexities of love, with engagements as young as 15 and two marriages that taught her as much about herself as they did about relationships. She also opens up for the first time publicly about her relationship with her father, who she recently lost.</p><br><p>This conversation explores Shirley’s rollercoaster life, her resilience, and her unyielding passion for dance. Behind the glamour lies a woman who’s faced intense scrutiny, reminding us of the importance of truly listening to the stories behind the spotlight.</p><br><p>If you enjoyed this episode, please click follow - we have so many great guests like this one, you won't want to miss out!</p><br><p>And don't miss the Strictly Christmas Special on BBC One on Christmas day!</p><br><p>You can also follow us on Instagram and Tiktok @greatcompanypodcast and if you'd like to get in touch, you can email us at greatcompany@jampotproducitions.co.uk</p><p>--</p><p>THE CREDITS</p><p>Exec Producer: Jemima Rathbone</p><p>Assistant Producer: Gurlina Heer</p><p>Video: Jake Ji</p><p>Social Media: Laura Coughlan</p><br><p>Great Company is an original podcast from JamPot&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

Behind the glamour lies a woman who’s faced intense scrutiny, reminding us of the importance of truly listening to the stories behind the spotlight.</p><br><p>If you enjoyed this episode, please click follow - we have so many great guests like this one, you won't want to miss out!</p><br><p>And don't miss the Strictly Christmas Special on BBC One on Christmas day!</p><br><p>You can also follow us on Instagram and Tiktok @greatcompanypodcast and if you'd like to get in touch, you can email us at greatcompany@jampotproducitions.co.uk</p><p>--</p><p>THE CREDITS</p><p>Exec Producer: Jemima Rathbone</p><p>Assistant Producer: Gurlina Heer</p><p>Video: Jake Ji</p><p>Social Media: Laura Coughlan</p><br><p>Great Company is an original podcast from JamPot&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.

						<description><![CDATA[<p>How much does it cost to become an Olympic athlete? Equipment, kit, gym, a coach, competitions, travel and time to train. When funding is cut for a sport, it makes an already tough mountain all the more impossible to climb.

With her infectious sense of humour, she is a huge advocate for change and inclusive spaces.

Despite his massive following, Caspar battled anxiety, to the point where he couldn't even go on a date with his fiancée [13.51]. He explores how he transitioned to running four successful businesses and the pressures of entrepreneurship [22.48] and how he has learned to embrace his Tourette's diagnosis at the age of six to the point where he is now proud of it.</p><br><p>If you enjoyed this episode, please click follow - we have so many great guests like this one, you won't want to miss out!</p><br><p>You can also follow us on Instagram and Tiktok @greatcompanypodcast</p><br><p>THE CREDITS:</p><p>Exec Producer: Jemima Rathbone</p><p>Assistant Producer: Gurlina Heer</p><p>Booking: Ben Johns</p><p>Video: Jake Ji</p><p>Social Media: Laura Coughlan</p><br><p>Great Company is an original podcast from JamPot</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
