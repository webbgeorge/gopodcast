      <title>Trump's Insurrection: Stop the Steal (Ep 2)</title>
      <description>It’s clear that Joe Biden has won the election but Donald Trump will not accept it. First, he brings together a ragtag bunch of lawyers and tries to overturn the results in the courts. He fails. Then he tries to lean on governors and individual states, famously calling Brad Raffensperger and asking him to ‘find’ 11,780 votes in Georgia. He fails. So all he’s left with is January 6th and the hope he can pressure Congress into not certifying the results.

Listen to Katty and Anthony discuss Trump’s attempts to deny Biden’s victory in the period between election day and January 6th, in the second episode in this miniseries on how he almost overthrew democracy.

      <title>Trump's Insurrection: The Collapse of His Presidency (Ep 1)</title>
      <description>At the start of 2020, Donald Trump would have been fairly confident of his reelection. The economy was strong, unemployment and inflation were low, and his approval rating was as high as it had ever been. Then it all fell apart. As he struggled to deal first with the Covid-19 pandemic and then the BLM protests, Donald Trump’s approval ratings collapsed. Going into election night it seemed certain that Joe Biden would win. Whilst he did so, things were far closer than expected and when Donald Trump went out at 2:30am to claim victory, American democracy entered a shaky period.

Listen to Katty and Anthony discuss the final year of Trump’s first presidency and the 2020 election. This is the first episode in this miniseries on the events of January 6th and how Trump almost overthrew democracy.

Today Katty and Anthony are joined by former CIA analyst and host of Goalhanger’s latest podcast, The Rest Is Classified, David McCloskey, to discuss this fascinating story.

      <title>Introducing... Legacy</title>
      <description>Listen to Legacy from Wondery and Goalhanger Podcasts. Each season, historian Peter Frankopan and broadcaster Afua Hirsch tell the wild stories of the most extraordinary men and women to have ever lived – and ask whether they have the reputation they deserve.
 
Born into great privilege, John F. Kennedy became one of the most influential world leaders of the 21st century. His liberal domestic agenda inspired optimism among the next generation of Americans whilst his foreign policies were defined by the Cold War and the space race. His assassination in 1963 sustains the public’s fascination and has cemented his place as one of the world’s most influential cultural and political icons. And with the US elections coming up, how much of it can we attribute to JFK?
 
In this clip of Legacy, JFK is in the eye of the storm of one of the most terrifying geo-political moments of modern history: the Cuban Missile Crisis. Will history look down on him as a hero or a failure?
 
Listen to Legacy on the Wondery App or wherever you get your podcasts: https://wondery.com/shows/legacy/. You can listen to Legacy episodes early and ad-free right now by joining Wondery+.

      <title>How Trump Won the White House: The Day that Changed America (Ep 4)</title>
      <description>It’s the 8th November, 2016, just past midnight and Donald Trump arrives at Grand Rapids, Michigan, for his last rally of the election. He’s bleary-eyed and feeling the strain, this is his tenth rally in the last two days. After flying through three time zones yesterday, he has now flown from Florida to North Carolina to Pennsylvania to New Hampshire, and finally here to Michigan. His one last shot at those Blue Wall states. He tells the crowd, ‘We're hours away from a once-in-a-lifetime change, Today is our Independence Day, the day the American working class is going to strike back, finally.’ Yet, going into election day The New York Times only gave Trump a 9% chance of winning. 

In the final episode of The Rest is Politics: US’ series on How Donald Trump Won the White House, listen as Anthony and Katty tell how election day unfolded and analyze the result. Why did Donald Trump win the White House?

      <title>How Trump Won the White House: Collusion, Collapse, and Chaos (Ep 3)</title>
      <description>A campaign trail like no other. Both sides experienced ups and downs aplenty. As August began Hillary was soaring in the polls whilst Trump’s campaign was bogged down by accusations of Russian collusion. Fast forward six weeks and the polls were narrowing. Trump had a new campaign team, his speeches were clearer and more coherent, and he was frenetically flying around the country. Meanwhile, Hillary had collapsed at the 9/11 memorial and called half of Trump’s supporters ‘deplorables’. Then came the October Surprises. After the release of the Access Hollywood tapes it seemed like it was all over for Trump, but then James Comey announced that the FBI were again looking at the Clinton email case, meaning America careered towards election day with Trump gaining on Hillary.

In the third episode of The Rest is Politics: US’ series on How Donald Trump Won the White House, listen as Anthony and Katty look at the campaign trail and the way the momentum continually swung from one candidate to another.

      <title>How Trump Won the White House: Did Obama Create Trump? (Ep 2)</title>
      <description>Make America Great Again. This Trump message has become widely recognisable since 2015, when he began articulating his protectionist, anti-Washington, nationalistic, America First message. Trump wanted to appeal to the ‘forgotten men and women’ of America, those who had been left behind by globalisation. But he could not do this alone, so what team did Trump establish around him? How did they help him formulate his strategy? And how was Hillary Clinton shaping up to challenge him after her bruising primary against Bernie Sanders?

In the second episode of The Rest is Politics: US’ series on How Donald Trump Won the White House, listen as Anthony and Katty look at how both sides of the race prepared for the campaign trail. What was their strategy, who were their teams, and what message were they taking into the race?

      <title>How Trump Won the White House (Ep 1)</title>
      <description>On Tuesday 16th June 2015, Donald Trump, flanked by Melania, came down the escalator at Trump Tower and before a crowded atrium announced that he would be running for president. Famous for being a businessman and the host of The Apprentice, everybody wrote him off. This was just a gimmick, he couldn’t win. However, he quickly established himself as the favorite for the nomination. Radical, straight-talking, and entertaining, he energized large sections of the Republican base. He blew away arch-establishment figures like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, and the more radical anti-Washington candidate Ted Cruz. Despite being a polarising figure right from the start, he turned the party upside down and on Tuesday 19th July 2016, Donald Trump was declared the official Republican Presidential candidate with 14,000,000 votes, the most received by any candidate in Republican primary history.

In the first episode of The Rest is Politics: US series on How Donald Trump Won the White House, listen as Anthony and Katty look at how he won the Republican nomination and changed the party forever.
