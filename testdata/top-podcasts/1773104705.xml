      <title>Fearne Cotton: I'm Saying No More and It Feels Great! At 43 I Feel More Me Than Ever.</title>
      <description>In the first episode of Begin Again, Davina McCall sits down with Fearne Cotton, a familiar face from our TV screens who found her true self after stepping away from the spotlights of fame and other people's expectations.

Starting her career as a TV presenter at just 15 years old, Fearne shares her journey of battling anxiety, panic attacks, and eating disorders while navigating the pressures of being in the spotlight.

It wasn’t until she stepped back from TV that she learned to prioritise her well-being and embrace the power of saying ‘no.’ Now navigating her through her midlife, Fearne reflects on finding peace, rejecting societal expectations, and gaining new perspectives.

Fearne Cotton is the founder of Happy Place and the host of the Happy Place podcast. Listen more here: https://open.spotify.com/show/1J6Ddy4dcXjFZDmWQs3Pu0
