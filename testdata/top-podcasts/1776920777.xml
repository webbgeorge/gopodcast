      <title>VANISHED: Jennifer Kesse</title>
      <description>When Rob Allen tried to contact his girlfriend, 24 year old Jennifer Kesse, on the morning of Tuesday January 24, 2006, his call went straight to voicemail. Hours later her loved ones grew concerned when they still couldn’t reach her. Authorities initially chalked it up as a voluntary choice. But hours later Jennifer’s car was found abandoned nearby and a shadowy figure was caught on camera. The question now was whether it was somehow linked to the odd behavior of the workers in Jennifer’s complex. Listen in as Maggie is joined by Payne Lindsey and the two dig deep to consider what may have really happened in one of the highest profile missing person's cases from the early 2000’s.

      <title>VANISHED: Jodi Huisentruit</title>
      <description>When 27 year old reporter Jodi Huisentruit didn’t show up for her daily morning news segment on Tuesday, June 27, 1995, her colleagues banded together to produce the show in her absence. But as the morning rolled on, concerns began to grow that she may be in danger. Authorities were soon tasked with figuring out whether an unusual call to the news station that morning and Jodi’s scattered belongings in her apartment parking lot were potential clues to her disappearance. Listen in as Maggie is joined by “Rattled &amp; Shook’s” Meredith Stedman as they try to unpack what happened to Iowa’s beloved missing news anchor.
