      <title>Spencer Pratt: How to Be Famous (FBF)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Spencer Pratt. Spoiler alert: Spencer gets pissed and storms out of the interview after Alex asks a triggering question. But, before the tantrum, Spencer name drops practically everyone in Hollywood and gives us the 101 on how to become famous. We know the drill, Spencer Pratt walked so Kim Kardashian could run. But according to Spencer, fame isn’t even cool anymore! We get the juicy tea on his attempt to join the Illuminati and his sleepover with Hillary Clinton. The OG villain, Spencer reminisces about the early days of reality tv - when he and Heidi were once the most famous (and hated) couple in the world. And then…the question that ended the interview. “You will obviously never be as relevant as you once were, how does that make you feel?”</p>

      <title>Aubrey O’Day: Overcoming Toxic Men (ft. Diddy, Trump &amp; Pauly D) (FBF)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Aubrey O’Day joins Call Her Daddy to reflect on nearly 20 years in the industry and the toxic men she met along the way. Aubrey shot to fame on one of MTV’s most popular shows, Making the Band, and was the first person selected in the girl group that emerged, Danity Kane. She recounts body shaming, manipulation and her experience with executive producer P. Diddy. Aubrey talks about the real reason Diddy fired her from Danity Kane - and it’s not what the public was told. Aubrey doesn’t hold back during this interview. She opens up about being the other woman, and shares details about her affair with Donald Trump Jr. She shares her thoughts on his father, the former president of the United States. Aubrey compares the abuse she took from her mother to the experience she had with DJ Pauly D from Jersey Shore. She details all the red flags she recognizes now - and wished she knew then. The public has had an opinion about how Aubrey looks for as long as she’s been in the industry. She opens up about how constant body shaming has impacted her - and the low point it brought her to. Today, Aubrey reclaims control over her narrative and looks back on her story with wisdom, humility and grace.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Father Cooper sits down with model and content creator, @remibader. Remi got her start on TikTok posting realistic clothing hauls and her platform has since expanded beyond fashion. Remi opens up and reflects on discrimination she’s faced since launching her career; for the first time, she tells the story of what actually went down this summer at a Hampton’s ranch where she was publicly humiliated and forced to leave due to her weight. Remi opens up about how she really feels towards the ‘influencers’ who decided participating in a low rent influencer horsey ride was more important than siding with their friend. Remi discusses her decision to seek outpatient treatment for her eating disorder and her ongoing journey to self-acceptance. Over wine, Remi dishes on her best dating stories and shares how one night of sex led to thousands of dollars in water damage. Trigger warning: This episode discusses adult subject matters, including descriptions of eating disorders and body dysmorphia. Listener discretion is advised.

When discussing her outfit of the day for the interview, she confesses to once splurging 40k on a national OOTD holiday. Settling some debates, Stassi shares her take on various trends, determining whether they are basic or not. Aperol Spritzes? GRWM videos? Prepare for an unexpected opinion as she weighs in on Ozempic. Alex and Stassi also take a moment to reflect on Stassi's growth since her time on Vanderpump Rules, reminiscing about some of her most iconic moments.

Stassi has a revelation that will shake Vanderpump fans to the core - she's not actually a birthday person. She gushes about how she knew her husband was "the one" and gives a glimpse into what her life is truly like without the cameras around.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Join Alex in the studio for an interview with Megan Moroney. Megan opens up about her childhood in Georgia, feeling lost in high school, never fully fitting in since she was a theater kid and a cheerleader, and how her first boyfriend was actually her brother’s best friend. She talks about her college experience, educates Alex on sorority life, and breaks down the times she was getting cheated on but convinced herself to stay. Megan and Alex realize they have the same professional athlete in their past and of course, Alex asks the question we’ve all been wondering… what exactly happened with Morgan Wallen? Megan also reveals that she is OG Daddy Gang but has traded the toxic for therapy and is truly thriving now. Finally, they discuss Megan’s rise to fame, her approach to songwriting, and her new album. Enjoy!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Join Father Cooper for a cozy Sunday session where she takes us all to Big Al bootcamp with questions of the week. Alex gives her take on whether or not you should tell your partner what type of engagement ring you want and reminds us why we should never leave important decisions to men.

Then, she reflects on the ways her life has changed over the past few years and why growing up should be exciting instead of scary. Finally, she shares her biggest takeaways from her wedding and how she and Matt managed to stay present and be in the moment throughout the weekend. Enjoy!</p>

She walks you through how to tell your BFF that you don’t like her boyfriend and also gives a PSA about being too old for hickies (it’s time to knock that vampire shit off)! Then, she reflects on the ways her life has changed over the past few years and why growing up should be exciting instead of scary. Finally, she shares her biggest takeaways from her wedding and how she and Matt managed to stay present and be in the moment throughout the weekend. Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Emma Chamberlain (Parts 1 and 2) (FBF)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Father Cooper is joined by Emma Chamberlain for her first official in-person sit-down interview. The pair discuss Emma’s high school days and cover everything from being an only child, her parents' divorce, and ultimately her decision to drop out and pursue Youtube full time (OH and they also discuss the classic high school dick pic). Alex and Emma open up and reflect on the fears associated with being a content creator... Who am I outside of the content I post? Is there any room for mistake? Can I do this forever? In response to all of this, Alex then asks Emma, “Have you ever considered just quitting?”. Emma recalls feeling used by other Youtubers in order to gain views and how she was burned by the people she once looked up to. The pair discuss feeling out of control of their public perception and the need to consequently address and debunk fake rumors. Emma describes the anxiety she experiences as a result of constantly being surveilled while out in public and the feeling of wanting to disappear. Let’s get into relationships and sex. Emma opens up about her struggles with her sexual identity, her ex-boyfriend, AND her new relationship. We also learn how Emma lost her virginity, what her favorite style of sex is, and what gives her the ick. Daddy Gang, enjoy both parts of this two-part interview with Emma Chamberlain. </p>

While you may think you have an understanding of Emily’s seemingly perfect life, this interview reveals that you never know what someone is actually going through.

      <title>Kristin Cavallari: So You Want to Date an Athlete? (FBF)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, a look back at Father Cooper's sit down with Kristin Cavallari. Can you imagine being in high school and having grown men with cameras following you around to stir up drama? Kristin can - and she reflects on those Laguna Beach days and explains why MTV should now be paying for the entire cast’s therapy. And, with Alex and Kristin well experienced in the world of hooking up with professional athletes, they give the inside scoop on what it’s like to date (or marry) one. Kristin opens up about her divorce - and how she knew when it was time to end her marriage to Jay Cutler. Kristin is hilariously honest and details a date gone horribly wrong with a stuntman, why she’s attracting an influx of 26 year olds, and what she looks for in a partner.</p>

      <title>Kristin Cavallari: So You Want to Date an Athlete? (REVISIT)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Call Her Daddy is on a break, so we're revisiting a classic episode - Father Cooper's sit down with Kristin Cavallari. Can you imagine being in high school and having grown men with cameras following you around to stir up drama? Kristin can - and she reflects on those Laguna Beach days and explains why MTV should now be paying for the entire cast’s therapy. And, with Alex and Kristin well experienced in the world of hooking up with professional athletes, they give the inside scoop on what it’s like to date (or marry) one. Kristin opens up about her divorce - and how she knew when it was time to end her marriage to Jay Cutler. Kristin is hilariously honest and details a date gone horribly wrong with a stuntman, why she’s attracting an influx of 26 year olds, and what she looks for in a partner.</p>

      <title>My Wedding Planning Disaster</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Step into the chaos that is Alex's wedding planning saga. She fully details her struggle to lock down a wedding location (hint: So far it has changed 7 times). Daddy Gang, you’ve asked and Alex is answering. Bridesmaids or no bridesmaids? Is she going big or keeping it low-key? Alex is taking a very non-traditional approach to her wedding and has the shocking revelation that she will be walking herself down the aisle, and her reasoning may not be what you'd expect. But that's not all—Alex makes a wild in-the-moment decision to go wedding dress shopping and takes you (and Mother Cooper!) along for the journey…but only after getting high as fuck. Will Big Al say yes to the dress? Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Exposing My Athlete Roster (Boston Edition)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Join Alex as she returns to her college town of Boston and enters a full state of regression as the memories from her athletes past flood in. A failed date with a Patriots player? An NHL player with the largest curved penis known to man? Alex is here with her BFF Laren to spill all of the hilarious stories from her college days in Boston. These two don't hold back – they share their own Boston shenanigans, including a trip to Planned Parenthood and Alex's not-so-fun encounter with chlamydia. The girls answer some questions from Daddy Gang and discuss how to handle age gaps in romantic relationships, how to have a conversation with a co-dependent friend and what it actually means if your boyfriend won’t go down on you (cough cough…he’s a misogynistic fuck). Prepare for an absolute ride that takes you on a journey down Big Al’s Boston athlete memory lane.</p>

Alex and Nancy discuss the common mistakes couples make when arguing and provide tangible strategies to implement during conflict. Nancy addresses why apologies don’t always land, when it’s okay to walk away from an argument, how to figure out the root of the conflict and more.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>The Chainsmokers: Cheating, Threesomes &amp; Toxic Exes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The Chainsmokers join Call Her Daddy to discuss their evolution — and if you love a wild and crazy story-time, this episode is for you. From the start, Alex Pall and Drew Taggart were a match made in heaven - the duo discuss working together for the past 10 years and how prioritizing the success of The Chainsmokers has impacted each of them personally. They don’t hold back when talking about their love lives and share all of their messiest, albeit hilarious, breakup stories. They’ve been spied on with an elaborate pet cam scheme - and caught someone offering herself for availability to get peed on in a Craigslist ad — all for money to score some blow. The guys spill all of the tea on the threesomes they’ve had (“that’s a lot of man”), and reveal if they’ve ever slept with a fan. The pair reflect on failed relationships and gush about their current girlfriends while sharing the personal growth required to get to this point.</p>

      <title>Keke Palmer: Codependent Relationships, Child Fame &amp; Insecurities (REVISIT)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Call Her Daddy will be taking a brief break this week, but we'll return on January 11, 2023 with a brand new episode. Please enjoy this older favorite from Call Her Daddy in the meantime. Father Cooper sits down with Keke Palmer. Keke shares the effects childhood fame had on her life - and how achieving early success left her feeling completely alone. Alex and Keke discuss a shared insecurity - debilitating acne - and how they still struggle to find confidence during breakouts.

      <title>Aubrey O’Day: Overcoming Toxic Men (ft. Diddy, Trump &amp; Pauly D)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Aubrey O’Day joins Call Her Daddy to reflect on nearly 20 years in the industry and the toxic men she met along the way. Aubrey shot to fame on one of MTV’s most popular shows, Making the Band, and was the first person selected in the girl group that emerged, Danity Kane. She recounts body shaming, manipulation and her experience with executive producer P. Diddy. Aubrey talks about the real reason Diddy fired her from Danity Kane - and it’s not what the public was told. Aubrey doesn’t hold back during this interview. She opens up about being the other woman, and shares details about her affair with Donald Trump Jr. She shares her thoughts on his father, the former president of the United States. Aubrey compares the abuse she took from her mother to the experience she had with DJ Pauly D from Jersey Shore. She details all the red flags she recognizes now - and wished she knew then. The public has had an opinion about how Aubrey looks for as long as she’s been in the industry. She opens up about how constant body shaming has impacted her - and the low point it brought her to. Today, Aubrey reclaims control over her narrative and looks back on her story with wisdom, humility and grace.</p>

      <title>Fuck the Male Gaze</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>How do you feel about your body? Have you ever stayed home from a social activity or other opportunity because of concern about how you looked? Have you ever passed judgment on someone because of how they looked or dressed? Have you ever had difficulty concentrating on a task because you were self-conscious about your appearance? This is self-objectification and it is the result of our beauty-obsessed world perpetuating the idea that happiness, health, and ability to be loved are dependent on how we look. Drs. Lindsay and Lexie Kite teach that positive body image isn’t believing your body looks good, it’s knowing your body is good, regardless of how it looks. They provide the tools to build resilience in a culture that objectifies and commodifies women’s bodies.</p>

      <title>Is Your Parent a Narcissist?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Is your parent a narcissist? In this episode, clinical psychologist Dr. Sherrie Campbell breaks down what happens when you come to the realization that your mom or dad should never have been a parent in the first place…children know when their parents don't want them. Dr. Campbell explains the effects narcissists have on their children. Survivors of this trauma can grow into adults who struggle with assertiveness, boundary setting and sense of self. She explores how the children of narcissists later find themselves dating someone with narcissistic tendencies. Cutting ties with toxic family members is a difficult decision. Dr. Campbell is an expert and a victim of this type of abuse. The survival tactics Dr. Campbell outlines in this episode are tools she developed while studying psychology, and implemented because she needed them herself. This episode discusses adult subject matter, including descriptions of emotional and physical abuse, and is intended for adult consumption only. Listener discretion is advised. If you have been affected by domestic abuse, free and confidential support is available 24/7 through the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800.799.7233 and online at www.thehotline.org</p>

      <title>Remi Bader: Don’t Call Me Body Positive (Summer Series)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Father Cooper sits down with model and content creator, @remibader. Remi got her start on TikTok posting realistic clothing hauls and her platform has since expanded beyond fashion. Remi opens up and reflects on discrimination she’s faced since launching her career; for the first time, she tells the story of what actually went down this summer at a Hampton’s ranch where she was publicly humiliated and forced to leave due to her weight. Remi opens up about how she really feels towards the ‘influencers’ who decided participating in a low rent influencer horsey ride was more important than siding with their friend. Remi discusses her decision to seek outpatient treatment for her eating disorder and her ongoing journey to self-acceptance. Over wine, Remi dishes on her best dating stories and shares how one night of sex led to thousands of dollars in water damage. Trigger warning: This episode discusses adult subject matters, including descriptions of eating disorders and body dysmorphia. Listener discretion is advised.

Kristin opens up about her divorce - and how she knew when it was time to end her marriage to Jay Cutler. While opening up about the current state of her dating life, Kristin is hilariously honest and details a recent date gone horribly wrong with a stuntman, why she’s attracting an influx of 26 year olds, and what she is currently looking for in a partner.</p>

      <title>Spencer Pratt: How to Be Famous (Summer Series)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Spencer Pratt. Spoiler alert: Spencer gets pissed and storms out of the interview after Alex asks a triggering question. But, before the tantrum, Spencer name drops practically everyone in Hollywood and gives us the 101 on how to become famous. We know the drill, Spencer Pratt walked so Kim Kardashian could run. But according to Spencer, fame isn’t even cool anymore! We get the juicy tea on his attempt to join the Illuminati and his sleepover with Hillary Clinton. The OG villain, Spencer reminisces about the early days of reality tv - when he and Heidi were once the most famous (and hated) couple in the world. And then…the question that ended the interview. “You will obviously never be as relevant as you once were, how does that make you feel?” </p>

Keke shares insight and advice from her own experience - she’s been in multiple codependent relationships and gives us the signs to spot one. Then, the duo address common dating dilemmas. Can you date your friend&apos;s ex? Should you ever go through your partner’s phone? Once a cheater always a cheater? Join Alex and Keke for these topics and more on this episode. Enjoy!</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Lottie Moss: Threesomes, Toxic Men &amp; Only Fans</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week Father Cooper sits down with Lottie Moss. Sure, she’s supermodel Kate Moss’ little sister, but Lottie has stepped out of the shadows and paved a path of her own. Lottie opens up about the dark and destructive nature of the modeling industry, how they permitted her drug use, and even encouraged it. After a recent and very public stay in rehab, Lottie took ownership of her life and cut out the toxic people. Lottie dishes on her move to LA and her venture into the Only Fans industry. She walks us through a day in the life while shooting content and hits us with story time to remind us that threesomes aren’t always all smiles (they sometimes end with you crying alone in the corner). And stay till the end…Alex and Lottie provide detailed advice on how to take the ultimate nude. Enjoy! </p>

      <title>Girl Talk: Drinking with Cazzie David</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper is joined by Cazzie David. Recently, the girls reached a milestone in their friendship…they went on vacation together. Alex and Cazzie debrief their Cabo trip and breakdown their first ever fight. Did Alex commit the largest possible vacation sin or is Cazzie just being dramatic? Right when it seems the tension has died down, Alex calls Cazzie out…for her cameo in a Hannah Montana episode (low blow?). At least the girls can agree on one thing - their love for reality television. If they were cast on the bachelor, what would their strategy be? Would Alex show up in sweats? In this rollercoaster ride of an episode Alex and Cazzie take us through MANY topics and constantly have us wondering…do they hate each other? Are they being serious or sarcastic? Guess you’ll just have to listen and decide for yourself. Enjoy!</p>

Alex and Cazzie debrief their Cabo trip and breakdown their first ever fight. Did Alex commit the largest possible vacation sin or is Cazzie just being dramatic? Right when it seems the tension has died down, Alex calls Cazzie out…for her cameo in a Hannah Montana episode (low blow?). At least the girls can agree on one thing - their love for reality television. If they were cast on the bachelor, what would their strategy be? Would Alex show up in sweats? In this rollercoaster ride of an episode Alex and Cazzie take us through MANY topics and constantly have us wondering…do they hate each other? Are they being serious or sarcastic? Guess you’ll just have to listen and decide for yourself. Enjoy!</p>

If you are one of the lucky few who has not experienced heartbreak, you surely know someone who has. Guy provides guidelines on how to be a good friend to someone experiencing a breakup while also ensuring that you are setting boundaries for your own mental health.

Alex hits us with the hard truth of why we should all be asking our partners about their exes. Let’s phone a friend (or two!) Alex calls Mr. Sexy Zoom Man and Harry Jowsey to hear the male perspective on learning about our exes. Last but not least, Big Al reveals an accidental voicemail she received and how someone she thought was her friend was shit talking her. Enjoy!</p>

      <title>Fuck Me with a Dildo</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper is coming to you live from a secret snowy location…and she’s not alone! Big Al is currently sharing a home with her ENTIRE family and Mr. Sexy Zoom Man (the sexual frustration is real). Alex details her plans to creatively and secretly get it in without her father finding out her true identity – the throat goat. Alex’s problems are so big this week she phones an expert – sex therapist Dr. Castellanos. What’s our new favorite thing on Call Her Daddy...some role play! Alex and Dr. Castellanos play out a variety of scenarios you have probably encountered at some point in your life. What if your partner doesn’t turn you on? What if you like masturbating more than sex? What if you’re flat out just too stressed at work to even think about sex? Dr. Castellanos gives us these answers and more. For all my horny daddies, let’s ramp this conversation up a bit. Let’s discuss dirty porn, giant dildos, and erotic fantasies! I guarantee when this episode ends you will be reaching for some lube and your clit – enjoy ;) </p>

Tune in this week Daddy Gang to hear from the expert herself – Esther Perel. To hear more from Esther, listen to her podcast Where Should We Begin?

      <title>Amanda Knox - “I didn’t fucking do it.”</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Amanda Knox. The interview begins with Amanda giving a clear reminder to the world – “I didn’t fucking do it”. In 2007, while studying abroad in Italy, Amanda was wrongly accused and convicted of murdering her roommate Meredith Kercher. Meredith was the victim of a brutal murder. Amanda was the victim of trial by media. Her sexuality was used against her in order to manipulate a story that she was a sex crazed murderer - and that was the story that overtook international headlines. Fourteen years later, Amanda is exhausted, and is still working to detach her name from a murder she did not commit. Tune in this week as Amanda details the events that occurred on November 2nd 2007, the interrogation process and the four years she spent in Italian prison. This captivating interview highlights Amanda’s struggle to reclaim both her name and her life. </p>

Let’s also discuss - can I date my brother’s best friend; do I prioritize family or the fuck? Has a significant other ever gifted you an iPhone? Well you lucky bastard, take it and run, because Big Al addresses when it is appropriate to buy someone an iPhone (spoiler alert…never – you’re being used). Last but not least, Father Cooper breaks down how to ask someone to get STD tested and when it is appropriate to hold blowjobs for ransom. If you’re horny and you know it clap your hands and go fucking listen – enjoy Daddies!  </p>

      <title>Emily Ratajkowski</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Emily Ratajkowski. While you may think you have an understanding of Emily’s seemingly perfect life, this interview reveals that you never know what someone is actually going through. Emily opens up about the traumatic experiences she has overcome throughout her life and how these events have reduced her to feeling like nothing more than a mannequin. Many are quick to dismiss Emily’s struggles because she has an envious body and posts provocative photos – but does one’s appearance diminish the pain and trauma they have experienced? Does one’s appearance and capitalization of their own body take away their ability to identify as a feminist? Tune in this week daddy gang – happy Wednesday. TRIGGER WARNING: This episode discusses adult subject matter, including descriptions of sexual violence, and is intended for adult consumption only. Listener discretion is advised. If you have been affected by sexual violence, free, confidential support is available 24/7 through RAINN's National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656-4673 and online.rainn.org. </p>

      <title>The Ex Encounter</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Halloween Sunday scaries got you down? Well this mini is sure to bring you up. Father Cooper begins by discussing the difficulty of managing your time between your friends and your significant other. Is it wrong to want to spend all of your time with your boyfriend? Are your friends just jealous? All of my struggling Catholics out there - please stand up. Big Al explains how she overcame the strict ideals of sex imposed by the Catholic church and how she currently fucks and sucks guilt free.  So, you’re a virgin? Well if your name isn’t Mary we are dropping the V word all together. Father Cooper discusses what to say to someone if you are having sex for the first time. Are you obligated to tell them? Should you take the secret to your grave? As great as Big Al is at having sex, some may say she is even more skilled at avoiding it. Alex gives a play by play on how to stop a hookup from going all the way while still keeping the mood flirty and fun. SOS – I’m going to see my ex, what do I do?! In this episode, Father Cooper fully breaks down the ex-encounter…what to do, what to say, and one specific move we all want to add to our arsenal. Last, but certainly not least, a tale as old as time…sexting. Big Al discusses how to handle that sext that went a little too far and got a little too freaky. Happy Halloween and enjoy daddies! </p>

      <title>Emma Kenney (ft. Shameless)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Emma Kenney. Emma spent more than half of her life starring as Debbie Gallagher on the TV show “Shameless” and in this episode Emma spills all of the tea about growing up on set. Emma even dishes which co-star she had a crush on. She gets personal and opens up about her decision to go to rehab at a young age and shares new insight on that experience. As a child actor on the set of an adult show, young Emma was exposed to many explicit topics (Weed! Cocaine! Dildos! Nymphos!) and even had her first kiss with the cameras rolling…and her dad in a front row seat. This episode sheds light (and many funny stories) on what it is like to grow up on the set of one of the most popular TV shows. Enjoy Daddies!  </p>

      <title>Stop Cyberbullying and Start Masturbating</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Ask and you shall receive…this mini episode is the second part of Father Cooper’s conversation with Eileen Kelly. So if you have not yet listened to the full Eileen Kelly episode – go get her done and then come on back. Big Al and Eileen continue the conversation around masturbation and hope to soon see all you daddies out there flicking the bean. We heard Eileen’s revenge porn story, but it doesn’t stop there, Eileen was also the victim of online stalking and harassment. Eileen shares everything… including what happened when the stalker was eventually caught and the conversation that went down. You may not have experience with the world of Hollywood agents, but everyone has had at least one shitty boss in their lifetime. Unfortunately for Eileen, she was dumped by her agent (no they weren’t dating) and as you would expect, Eileen spills all of the tea. Enjoy daddy-hoes. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Cazzie David (despite Cazzie’s last minute efforts to ditch). The two then get serious and discuss family relationships and social media. Cazzie details what the pilot episode of her family’s reality TV show would be and Alex reminds the world that she does in fact have a sister. Building upon last week’s episode, the duo discusses the negative impact of social media along with the popular Tik Tok trend, the notion of a “pick me girl”. While on pop culture they also discuss the D’Amelio show, the Scott Disick dm, and last but certainly not least…Larry David at fashion week. This is Call Her Daddy, so let’s talk dating and relationships. Alex and Cazzie dive deep into the concept of love bombing and Cazzie offers up examples from her own personal experience. The girls give advice on how to recognize the warning signs and overcome an abusive relationship. This episode surely contains a little bit of everything – enjoy daddies! </p>

      <title>I Got Caught Photoshopping</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper addresses a recent Tik Tok that went viral after exposing her for photoshopping. Opening up a larger conversation Alex discusses the role insecurities and bullying from her childhood play in her current relationship to social media. Why is there such a pressure to edit photos? Does it really matter if everyone does it? Is she only saying this because she was caught? Will she continue to edit photos? Following this discussion, Father Cooper speaks with Dr. Jean Twenge who holds a PHD in psychology and is a personality and social psychologist. Dr. Twenge has authored multiple books, has over 140 scientific publications and her research focuses on generational differences and more recently the influence of social media.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper addresses a recent Tik Tok that went viral after exposing her for photoshopping. Opening up a larger conversation Alex discusses the role insecurities and bullying from her childhood play in her current relationship to social media. Why is there such a pressure to edit photos? Does it really matter if everyone does it? Is she only saying this because she was caught? Will she continue to edit photos? Following this discussion, Father Cooper speaks with Dr. Jean Twenge who holds a PHD in psychology and is a personality and social psychologist. Dr. Twenge has authored multiple books, has over 140 scientific publications and her research focuses on generational differences and more recently the influence of social media. The pair continue the conversation surrounding the negative impacts of social media on one’s mental health. </p>

      <title>Nico Tortorella</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Nico Tortorella. Nico is both an accomplished actor and author. In June of 2016, Nico came out as sexually fluid, and in their book, Space Between, they wrote, “I am comfortable today calling myself a queer, nonbinary, bisuexual, happily married, polyamorous/non-monogamous human being.” In this interview the pair dives deep into Nico’s life and discusses topics ranging from sex and sexuality to overcoming alcoholism. Father Cooper and Nico also discuss polyamory and how Nico’s polyamorous relationship with their partner Bethany has evolved over time. Why is the hotel where the interview is occurring triggering to Nico...they’ve had sex all over it?! Daddies - enjoy an episode that is both vulnerable and simultaneously hilarious. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Did someone say…mini episode? This week, wisdom is spewing out of Father Cooper’s asshole like lava. Should you believe a guy when he says you need to be “friends” so he can “work on himself”? Big Al also advises on topics ranging from the classic small penis problem to how to properly go to titty-town. In the spirit of health and wellness (and growth) let's revisit an old topic – do men love “the crazy”? Lastly, just to make sure we stay on brand, let’s discuss therapy and drugs. Honestly, does this episode even count as a mini? Enjoy daddies! </p>

      <title>Free Therapy and Drugs for All</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Laren (that bitch still hasn’t left) in an attempt for redemption. The girls have put down the bottle and picked up … a book? After reading (a chapter) of Esther Perel’s Mating in Captivity, the pair get serious and analyze their own lives while contemplating the question, can passion and stability coexist in a relationship? The duo discusses a spectrum of dating topics ranging from being single to taking accountability within a relationship. It’s hard to tell where book club ends and girl talk (free therapy?) begins but this week every topic is tackled… dating, friendship and life. Spoiler alert…Richard is back and the girls have one final bender in LA before Big Al sends Laren home (for the sake of both her reputation and liver). Enjoy Daddies! </p>

      <title>Heidi Montag</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper sits down with Heidi Montag, and lots of champagne. The pair get things popping off immediately…poppin bottles that is. Heidi takes us to Italy (sorry not France) where she spent her final year of high school. If you are here for The Hills drama, Heidi does not hold back and dishes all of the tea regarding her plastic surgeries and her former co-star Lauren Conrad (i.e. Lauren didn’t live up to her potential). How many orgasms a night are you having? This episode we learn Speidi are having 4-5 a night! Pour yourself a glass and chug along with Big Al and Heidi because this episode is surely a ride. Enjoy Daddies! </p>

      <title>Blacking Out in a City Near You (ft. me)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper begins by recalling a traumatizing memory from childhood that somehow managed to seep its way into her current relationship. Old habits never truly die and we all pause to witness a moment of regression in our dear daddy. Speaking of relationships, do we dare drop the L word…lube, labia, libido? Clench your assholes as Father Cooper finally and formally introduces Henry to the world (and I say ‘clench’ because I know a certain b-word really fires some of you up). Be sure to stick around for the announcement of Father Cooper’s world tour…yes she is finally taking up her pop star career. Big Al is taking no back seat to hot girl summer and is taking you along with her on her upcoming adventures. Yes, Betty…this tour once again includes a trip to France…god you greedy whores. </p>

      <title>116- Dirty Deets from The #1 Playboy Bunny (ft. Holly Madison)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Father Cooper is joined by an ICONIC guest, former playmate, Holly Madison. During her 20s, Holly entered the Playboy mansion and became one of the many girlfriends of Hugh Hefner, the infamous founder of Playboy magazine. Holly walks the daddy gang through her childhood and relationship with her family, as well as the struggles she experienced internally and socially that eventually led her to not only become a Playboy bunny, but to join the inner circle of women exclusively intimate with Heff, who at the time was 74. Holly’s truth about life in the mansion is radically different than how it was portrayed on the successful reality show, ‘The Girls Next Door.’ Strict curfews, clothing allowances, plastic surgery funds, love bombing, cult behavior, verbal and emotional abuse, were all creatively promoted as the never-ending party for the elite due to the manipulative disguise of one man’s money and power. Holly Madison, who went on to build an amazing career (headlining the Peep Show in Vegas, securing a spot on Dancing with the Stars, and becoming a New York Times #1 best selling author), shares her journey of battling through depression and repression in a misogynistic era, and although navigating through the most difficult time in her life, shows the strength of not only someone who survived, but thrived and did not allow a powerful and wealthy man to tear her down. </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>DADDY GANG-This week, Alex discusses the intense fallout of her decision to ghost her therapist for 3 straight weeks while being in a foreign country quarantining with a man. Not smart Big Al! Then, the first ever Daddy Gang member sits down with Alex to join the show this week! Katie Florence, who started her career as a substitute-school teacher now turned Tik-Tok star, initially caught Alex’s attention from the relationship comedy videos she was making during quarantine. The girls messaged on insta and then Katie flew up to NYC to record an episode with The Father. She brings vulnerability and relatability to the show this week, explaining her consistent and frustrating issue of always getting ghosted, being addicted to toxic dick, and the struggles and stress that come with finding ‘the one’ worth settling down for. She also walks us through a time in her life when she was in a Polyamorous relationship, detailing specifics of what it is like to date a man who is dating multiple women, how condoms work in the dynamic, and STD testing. The episode provides a fun new dating perspective from someone other than Alex’s big head. It’s fun to explore the dating world through someone else’s eyes in this week’s episode, especially when it's Daddy Gang :) ENJOY!! </p>

Hannah has a 44 year old boyfriend who she has fallen in love with and moved in with?!?! What has quarantine done to us! The women also detail the dirty FaceTime sex they have been having with their men, the perfect toilet angle for the p*ssy(?!), discuss the ass eating they are loving, and the angles that make your asshole look fabulous. ALSO, Hannah explains a strange phenomenon she is experiencing that includes only being able to have an orgasm when her legs are straight. ENJOY DADDY GANG!!! </p>

      <title>91- Dabble with Emasculating Him (ft Olivia O&apos;Brien)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, your single father brings you along the journey as she narrates her first date with Mr. Sexy Zoom Man, and you can clearly hear the sexual tension through the microphone. THEN, the beautiful and talented singer/songwriter Olivia O’Brien, well known for writing songs about the men she dates (very on brand with CHD) joins the show. Olivia dishes new information about the “house rule,” which will tell you who has the power in your relationship. She also details a recent cheating scandal that her friend Charli publicly went through. Moral of the story, never trust your man when he says he doesn’t have a second snapchat :) Alex & Olivia also discuss being a good friend to your girl friends, trust issues, dating in LA, and awful sex that is being had. Olivia also recounts a time she blacked out and slapped a man in the face. Great times this week. ENJOY! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>WE ARE BACK. Get ready for a very different episode this week. The girls have decided to do Call Her Daddy a little different this year starting with a HUGE announcement from Sofia and a deeply personal account from Alex. The Fathers have feelings!? Don't worry, they are still just as unwell. This week's episode addresses the topic of 'first impressions' with your significant other's friends and family and how to handle it. The girls roast the women who try too hard to be “one of the guys”, and last but not least, some hot girl-on-girl talk. Cheers to 2020! </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's episode kicks off with a mental breakdown from Alex who went snooping at a guys house and saw something she shouldn't have. Risky business! Also, the girls discuss why they (and women everywhere) can't cum during sex and a revolutionary way to take an a** pic. Ladies, this will be the only nude you will want to take from now on, GUARANTEED. Plus, the girls debate if it's ever okay to send a dirty video.…that includes you having sex with someone else. Hot? Or not? </p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In this week's episode, Alex and Sofia are giving health and wellness a good ol' fashioned try. You heard that right! The girls discuss the importance of “having your own life” in a relationship and where so many women go wrong- especially WAGS, (wives and girlfriends of professional athletes). They also discuss the most cringe-y thing a guy can post on his dating profile (no thanks), clout chasing, and most importantly WALKS OF SHAME. Otherwise known as a stride of pride for a true daddy. Enjoy! </p>
