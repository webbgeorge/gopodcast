    <title>The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett</title>
    <language>en</language>
    <copyright></copyright>
    <description>I was a broke, university dropout, at 18 I built an industry leading social media marketing company, and at 27 I resigned as CEO. At 28 I co-founded Flight Story – a marketing and communications company, and thirdweb - a software platform, making it easy to build web3 applications. I then launched private equity fund, Flight Fund, to accelerate the next generation of European unicorns. During this time I decided to launch 'The Diary Of A CEO' podcast with the simple mission of providing an unfiltered journey into the remarkable stories and untold dimensions of the world’s most influential people, experts and thinkers. Thank you for listening.

      <title>Moment 197: The 10-Minute Rule That Beats ANY Bad Habit &amp; This Weird Trick Forms Good Habits Instantly! Professor Steve Peters &amp; Nir Eyal</title>
      <description>In this episode we discover the science behind habits, how they're formed, how they can be broken, and the fascinating role self-perception plays in the process. We explore the power of reframing uncomfortable tasks, how habits are influenced by our self-image, and why pushing yourself too hard can backfire. You'll also learn why willpower is a limited resource, how to use discomfort as a tool for growth, and why small, achievable goals are the key to lasting change.

      <description>In this moment, small business expert, Codie Sanchez discusses how speed and self belief are the core traits for success.

Some of the most successful people in the world have what has been labelled a ‘reality distortion field’.

Codie says that we actually all have this ability, and can make ourselves belief we are capable of achieving anything, and as a result we are more likely to achieve what we set set our minds to.

Secondly, people need to adopt a bias towards action and decrease the time between thinking and doing. Codie says that time is the most important currency of our lives and too often we waste it by not having a sense of urgency. By taking action quickly, you can learn and adapt on the path to success before others have even started.

      <title>Moment 195: 10 Things Your Poo Says About Your Health: The No.1 Poo &amp; Gut Scientist</title>
      <description>In this moment, the gastroenterologist and gut health expert Dr Will Bulsiewicz breaks down everything you need to know about how your poo is one of the biggest signs of your overall health.Will says that too often we see poo as disgusting rather than a major clue of our health, as he says poo for a gastroenterologist is what checking the pulse is for a cardiologist. He says that signs can range from the size, smell and shape of poo, all of which can indicate anything from a poor diet to colon cancer. This is because 60% of your poo is bacteria and a direct window into the state of your microbiome which impacts all areas of your mental and physical wellbeing.

      <title>Moment 189: This Is The Real Reason You Can't Change Your Life: Doctor Alok Kanojia</title>
      <description>In this moment, world-leading men’s mental health coach and psychiatrist, Dr K discusses the ways people try and fail to put trauma behind them as well as the REAL way to overcome it.

Most people who have a history of trauma will try and overcompensate in the way they build their future lives. For instance, people can try to overcome the trauma of bullying by becoming invisible or becoming successful to overcoming past shame. However, no matter what people do to adapt to the historic trauma, it still remains in the mind. This can be seen in peoples responses to events that trigger memories of their past trauma.

Instead of this overcompensation, Dr K says that you need to dismantle your worldview by slowing down the mind and paying attention to your thoughts and feelings. He believes that this awareness is a superpower that everyone is ignoring, as the more aware you are in the present moment, the more your problems fade away.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this moment, world-leading men’s mental health coach and psychiatrist, Dr K discusses the ways people try and fail to put trauma behind them as well as the REAL way to overcome it.</p><p><br></p><p>Most people who have a history of trauma will try and overcompensate in the way they build their future lives. For instance, people can try to overcome the trauma of bullying by becoming invisible or becoming successful to overcoming past shame. However, no matter what people do to adapt to the historic trauma, it still remains in the mind. This can be seen in peoples responses to events that trigger memories of their past trauma.</p><p><br></p><p>Instead of this overcompensation, Dr K says that you need to dismantle your worldview by slowing down the mind and paying attention to your thoughts and feelings. He believes that this awareness is a superpower that everyone is ignoring, as the more aware you are in the present moment, the more your problems fade away.</p><p><br></p><p>Listen to the full episode here -</p><p><br></p><p>Spotify- <a href="https://g2ul0.app.link//Y3cK1DDNTOb">https://g2ul0.app.link//Y3cK1DDNTOb</a></p><p>Apple - <a href="https://g2ul0.app.link//nbunQIHNTOb">https://g2ul0.app.link//nbunQIHNTOb</a></p><p><br></p><p>Watch the Episodes On Youtube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos</a></p><p>Dr Alok: <a href="https://www.healthygamer.gg/dr-alok-kanojia">https://www.healthygamer.gg/dr-alok-kanojia</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Steven Shares His Secret Diary: Dealing With Liam Payne’s Death, My Big Relationship Issue, These 4 Words Saved Me!</title>
      <description>STEVEN’S DIARY IS BACK! It’s been a long time, since I’ve done this. In this episode I talk about heartbreak, grief, business challenges, relationship struggles, advice from Sir David Brailsford and protecting my mental health - all of it is unfiltered. 

When I first started The Diary Of A CEO, the central idea of the show, was to read my personal diary every week – I believed that It might be interesting to get to see inside the very personal diary of someone that was running a business with hundreds of team members, at 25ish years old, while contending with all of life’s problems, relationships, mental health challenges, mistakes, business issues, family problems, and more. So late on Sunday night once in a while, I would pull up a microphone in my old apartment, and I would read through my diary for 45 minutes or an hour.

The Diary Of A CEO took on a life of it’s own, I went from reading my diary, to interviewing other people about their diaries, to speaking to experts about all the problems that I cared about.

But every single week, someone will come up to me and tell me they found value in those early episodes, and they’ll ask me if I would ever share my diary again… So this weekend, I finally decided to give it go. This episode is my diary. The original, Diary Of A CEO.

      <title>Moment 188: The Real Reason You're Always Tired: Professor Guy Leschziner </title>
      <description>In this moment, the world-renowned expert in Neurology and Sleep Medicine, Professor Guy Leschziner outline why sleep is crucial to every aspect of your life, and the biggest mistake people make when it comes to get a good night’s sleep.

Humans spend a third of their lives sleeping, however science still understands very little about it. Guy says that sleep is of fundamental importance to humans otherwise evolution would have removed it.

Despite its importance, Guy thinks that people underestimate the power of sleep. He’s says that too often people make lifestyle choices that ensure they will have the worst possible sleep, which can then impact everything from their immune system, cardiovascular system, and mental health.

      <title>Moment 187: The Pregnancy Doctor REVEALS 3 Ways To INCREASE Your Chances Of Pregnancy NATURALLY</title>
      <description>In this moment, world-renowned fertility expert Dr Natalie Crawford discusses how to improve your chances of conceiving. According to Dr Natalie, timing is a key factor in achieving pregnancy, and she explains that the optimal window for conceiving happens around the ovulation phase of a woman’s menstrual cycle. Dr Natalie also addresses common misconceptions about fertility, including the idea that engaging in sex less frequently helps to preserve sperm. Instead, she explains that regular sex actually increases the likelihood of conception by ensuring access to healthy sperm. For those who are unable to rely on timing and frequency alone, Dr Natalie recommends alternatives such as intrauterine insemination. She also encourages women to gain a better understanding of their menstrual cycles, not only to support conception but also as an indicator of their overall health.

      <title>Moment 186: Why You Have No Friends: Simon Sinek </title>
      <description>In this moment, world-renowned author, entrepreneur, and optimist Simon Sinek discusses the importance of maintaining meaningful friendships throughout your life. For Simon, strong friendships are essential because they provide a support system during tough times. He also says it is important for friendships to offer companionship during moments of joy and success. According to Simon, there are several health benefits of close relationships, highlighting that in Blue Zones - regions where people live past 80 years old - a sense of community is key. From an evolutionary standpoint, our bodies seem to be designed to foster connection. He points out that the heart is our most vital organ, and that thigh muscles helped us socialise with others in our communities. Simon highlights that friendships should be approached with intention, and that one of the best ways to nurture your friendships is by supporting others, particularly through acts of service.

      <title>Moment 184: I Was Kidnapped Whilst Running The Entire Length Of Africa: Russ Cook</title>
      <description>He became the first person to run the full length of Africa—10,000 miles in 352 days—but just after day 100, Russ Cook, aka the Hardest Geezer, faced the toughest challenge of his life. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Russ found himself running through chaos, dodging violence, and literally outrunning men armed with machetes. With threats of kidnapping looming and his life on the line, he managed to escape and keep pushing forward.

Months later, after enduring sandstorms in the Sahara, crossing rainforests, and navigating endless stretches of empty road, Russ finally completed his journey. Starting in Cape Agulhas, South Africa, and finishing in Tunisia, he covered the equivalent of 386 marathons.

Throughout the journey, Russ faced life-threatening dangers—armed robberies, kidnappers, and harsh terrains. But the craziest part? After all those miles, he realised what he’d really been running from—and had to face it head on.

His story isn’t just about running. It’s for anyone facing their fears, questioning their path, or trying to break free from what’s been holding them back—because that was him too.

Russ unpacks all of this, and more, in his book HARDEST GEEZER: Mind Over Miles. Out now.

Starting in Cape Agulhas, South Africa, and finishing in Tunisia, he covered the equivalent of 386 marathons.</p><p><br></p><p>Throughout the journey, Russ faced life-threatening dangers—armed robberies, kidnappers, and harsh terrains. But the craziest part? After all those miles, he realised what he’d really been running from—and had to face it head on.</p><p><br></p><p>His story isn’t just about running. It’s for anyone facing their fears, questioning their path, or trying to break free from what’s been holding them back—because that was him too.</p><p><br></p><p>Russ unpacks all of this, and more, in his book HARDEST GEEZER: Mind Over Miles.

      <title>Moment 183: The Warning Signs Your Body Needs More Nutrients: Dr Mindy Pelz</title>
      <description>In this moment, the fasting and hormone expert, Dr Mindy Pelz discusses how your body can show your liver health.
Mindy says that there are simple ways that you can check how well your liver is function by looking at your eyes, feet and tongue.
She says that If the corner of your eye is yellow it can show liver stagnation, which means that the liver will struggle to metabolise toxins like alcohol. Equally, if the bottom of your feet are dry and cracking, it shows there is not proper circulation and your liver is struggling to detox.
Mindy says that some of the core reasons for this poor liver function is a lack of minerals and proper nutrients. However, this can be turned around with a mixture of fasting and getting in the right fruits and vegetables.

      <itunes:summary>In this moment, the fasting and hormone expert, Dr Mindy Pelz discusses how your body can show your liver health.
Mindy says that there are simple ways that you can check how well your liver is function by looking at your eyes, feet and tongue.
She says that If the corner of your eye is yellow it can show liver stagnation, which means that the liver will struggle to metabolise toxins like alcohol. Equally, if the bottom of your feet are dry and cracking, it shows there is not proper circulation and your liver is struggling to detox.
Mindy says that some of the core reasons for this poor liver function is a lack of minerals and proper nutrients. However, this can be turned around with a mixture of fasting and getting in the right fruits and vegetables.

      <title>Extended Moment: Guy Raz: Why 99% of Businesses Fail &amp; This Secret Made Apple, Pixar, &amp; Elon Musk Billions!</title>
      <description>In this moment, the host of ‘How I Built This’, discusses the lessons he has learned from interviewing over 20,000 people, ranging from global CEO’s, superstars to rural shepherds in Afghanistan. 

 Guy has built his career on the idea that every business is a story, and this business must tell this story to itself and others. He believes that all successful founders share common traits and outlooks, such as: fearing the regret of not trying more than the fear of failure. Believing in their product so much that they have almost superhuman endurance, and continue despite multiple failures. Guy also says that the most successful founders often don’t do it alone and have a co-founder to help them withstand the highs and lows of entrepreneurship.

      <title>Moment 182: How To Make People Respect You In Seconds: Evy Poumpouras</title>
      <description>In this moment, former U.S. Secret Service Special Agent Evy Pompouras discusses how to earn and maintain respect in the workplace. According to Evy, it is important to reflect on your own actions when faced with disrespect. This includes assessing the tone and pitch of your voice to see if any changes could lead to gaining more respect. The same principle applies to self-assessments of your contributions in the workplace, as Evy emphasises that people who speak too much often lose respect in the workplace while those who provide meaningful insight gain in. Evy also recommends addressing signs of disrespect straight away rather than avoiding the situation. Although difficult conversations may be uncomfortable, they can ultimately strengthen relationships and improve future interactions.

      <title>Moment 181: 5 Things Your Body Is Probably Missing, That's Making You Sick! Gary Brecka</title>
      <description>In this moment, professional Human Biologist Gary Brecka discusses the simple actions that people can take everyday to prevent chronic diseases. These preventative steps include drinking mineralised water, taking Omega 3 supplements, but also having a morning routine that incorporates Mother Nature, using grounding and breathwork. Gary believes that these steps have a psychological benefit as well, as they represent internal promises that you make to yourself, and if you fulfil them every day, it helps to instil self-confidence and trust.

      <description>In this moment, professor and neuroscientist, Wendy Suzuki outlines how to destroy your brain.
Many of the ways to wreck your brain health are obvious, such as poor sleep, smoking, eating a processed diet and no exercise. However, some brain damaging habit are more subtle, including not learning and using social media.
Wendy says that the increased use of social media is a massive concern for how it will impact the younger generation.

      <description>In this moment, entrepreneur and best selling author, Mohammad "Mo" Gawdat, discusses the root cause of stress in your life.

He believes that many of the stressors of your life can easily be cut out if you spend time deliberately looking at and reflecting on your life. After this you can then choose to limit what you allow into it, and help break the toxic addiction to stress we all suffer from in the modern world.

      <title>Moment 178: They're Lying To About Low Fat Foods, THIS Is What They're Doing!: Tim Spector</title>
      <description>In this moment, world renowned gut heath expert, Tim Spector discusses how to navigate the modern food landscape and overcome the brainwashing of the food industry. It turns out that answering the seemingly simple question of, ‘what is quality food?’ is a lot more difficult that it first appears. Too often foods packaged as ‘healthy’, ‘low calorie’ or ‘low fat’ are in fact the opposite. Instead, Tim believes we need to go back to eating foods in their simplest, unpackaged original form as nature intended.

      <title>Moment 177: You're NOT Lazy! This Is The REAL Reason You Procrastinate: The Performance Doctor </title>
      <description>According to Adam, procrastination is a natural part of the creative process, and rather than a method of avoiding hard work, it is a defence mechanism. Procrastination can be a method of protecting yourself against what you find to be psychologically challenging, or a way to avoid negative emotional feelings such as confusion, boredom, anxiety and fear. In order to beat procrastination, Adam says that you need to identify what negative emotions are stirred up by tasks that you consistently put off. Once you have identified these you can then change them by reframing them into a more interesting challenge.

      <title>Moment 176: 5 RED FLAGS Of A Secret Narcissist: The Narcissism Doctor </title>
      <description>In this moment, clinical psychologist Dr. Ramani Durvasula discusses the characteristics of narcissistic individuals and how to recognise if you are in a narcissistic relationship. According to Dr. Ramani, narcissists are typically entitled, self-centred, lack empathy, and are highly socially perceptive. Early in a relationship, they can be attentive and say all the right things, but Dr. Ramani says that a shift usually occurs midway through the relationship when they become distant and passive aggressive. Dr. Ramani explains that there are key signs you can look for to determine if you are in a narcissistic relationship. By paying attention to the ‘3 Rs’ - Ruminate, Regret, and Recall - you can acknowledge the unhealthy behaviour of your partner and free yourself from the relationship.

      <title>Moment 175: How To Build A ROUTINE You’ll ACTUALLY Stick To!: Navy Seal Jocko Willink</title>
      <description>In this moment, former Navy SEAL officer, Jocko Willink, discusses how to successfully build healthy habits and routines. Jocko is an expert in this area, having established a morning routine of waking up at either 4:30 or 4:45 a.m. every day. According to Jocko, there is no universal approach to establishing a new morning routine, and instead it is about finding what works best for you. While some people are early risers, others prefer to wake up later in the morning, and the best approach is to choose the routine that you can consistently maintain. The same principle applies to creating and sustaining an exercise routine, although Jocko recommends exercising in the morning to start your day in the right direction. Although Jocko has mastered consistency in his morning and exercise routine, he acknowledges that perfection isn’t the goal. Instead, you should embrace imperfection and focus on creating consistency and discipline in your life.

      <title>Moment 174: Trauma Doctor Reveals Every Type Of Trauma &amp; It’s Effects In 10 Minutes</title>
      <description>In this moment, world-renowned trauma expert, Paul Conti discusses the different forms that trauma can take.

Paul defines trauma as anything that overwhelms your coping mechanisms, which in turn changes the structure of your brain.

Trauma can be broken down into 3 types: acute, chronic, or vicarious.
Acute is a very evident type of trauma, and the one most people think of, this includes PTSD. Chronic trauma occurs over a longer period of time, and includes racism, bullying and neglect. Finally, vicarious trauma is the trauma people can get due to empathising with another person’s trauma and feeling their pain.

Paul also outlines the hypothesis of ‘multiple hit’ trauma. This is the idea that after multiple traumas it can became too much for a person to cope with, and even a small trauma can then push a person over the edge. This hypothesis completely disproves the idea that what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.

      <title>Moment 173: The SIMPLE Way People Make MONEY Without Working Harder!: The Money Making Expert</title>
      <description>In this moment, award-winning serial entrepreneur Daniel Priestley discusses effective strategies for accumulating assets to build wealth. According to Daniel, it is essential to create a diverse portfolio of assets, such as a strong personal brand or a vibrant company culture, because income naturally follows assets. Daniel also discusses the importance of investing your disposable income in personal development, such as taking courses to enhance essential skills, as well as in your personal relationships. One of the ways that you can strengthen your connections is by hosting dinner parties or taking successful mentors out for lunch. By investing in your relationships, you are not just learning new skills from a mentor, but you are also opening doors to potential income opportunities in the future.

      <title>Moment 172: 5 Body Language Rules To Read Anyone INSTANTLY!: Robert Greene</title>
      <description>In this moment with best-selling author and world renowned thinker Robert Greene, he discusses the importance of body language and nonverbal communication. Robert says this form of communication is one that you cannot lie about, as we have a deeply rooted human and emotional response to it. Body language isn’t just one subtle gesture, but hundreds of different small signs, from a look, a gesture, to the complete vibe a person gives off. Even when people try to fake their body language, a good observer can always tell, from someone looking you in the eye but with their mind elsewhere, a tone of voice that reveals a persons lack of confidence, to a fake smile that is proven false compared to a genuine smile. Sometimes the clearest reveal is the micro expression someone unwillingly shows in the fraction of a second before they put on the act of who they want to appear to be.

      <title>Moment 171: STOP DOING THIS! It's Ruining Your Sex Life</title>
      <description>In this moment, world-renowned philosopher and thinker Alain De Botton discusses how communication can lead to a better sex life. Alain says sex is like a mirror to the relationship as a whole. If something is wrong with a couples sex life, it’s usually a symptom of a wider problem. He says that a first step towards a more fulfilling sex life is reflecting on how you are as a partner. Being open about yourself in a relationship is the best way to create mutual trust, which means that you can ‘tease’ out any issue in a relationship. This then leads to being open with one another sexually.

      <title>Moment 170: The Scientific Method For Unstoppable Confidence: Professor Steve Peters</title>
      <description>In this moment, elite sport psychologist, Professor Steve Peters discusses the way to overcome low self-esteem. Often low self-esteem manifests itself outwardly in abusive relationships, the wrong career, and impulsive behaviours. Dr Peters says these are ‘maladaptive coping strategies’, where you are punishing yourself, thinking that you don’t deserve to treat yourself well, as you believe that you fundamentally don’t deserve happiness. Dr Peters says the solution can be as simple as getting a blank piece of paper and writing down who you want to be, and what behaviours you want to have. He says that this exercise works, as once you remove the interference of your mind, this person you hope to become is actually you, as you are defining yourself.

      <title>Moment 169: CIA Spy Reveals How To AVOID Media Manipulation &amp; Brainwashing: Andrew Bustamante</title>
      <description>In this moment, the former CIA intelligence officer Andrew Bustamante discusses the crucial techniques of manipulation, which he describes as a core part of CIA training. Andrew  introduces the R.I.C.E. analogy, which stands for Reward, Ideology, Coercion, and Ego. This framework is essential for understanding the motivations of others, allowing you to connect with them, build relationships, and influence their actions. According to Andrew, reward involves anything the other person desires, while ideology reflects the person’s core beliefs and is the most powerful element of the acronym. Coercion involves using negative behaviours on someone such as guilt or blackmail, and ego relates to how the other person sees themselves. Andrew translates this manipulation technique to marketing. He suggests that by sending targeted messages to your audience and assessing their responses, you gain insights into their ideology, providing you with useful information for future sales.

      <title>Moment 168: STOP Doing THIS! It's Hurting Your Sleep!: The Fitness Scientist </title>
      <description>You might have heard the phrase ‘circadian rhythm’ a lot but never really understood what it meant. In this moment, world-renowned human performance expert, Kristen Holmes gives a simple break down of this rhythm and its massive impacts. Kirsten says that the circadian rhythm is basically physical, mental and behavioral changes that happen over a 24 hour cycle. All of these changes are controlled by a master clock in your brain regulating every cell in your body through chemical signals. Disrupting this rhythm can cause massive health consequence such as cancer, metabolic and cardiovascular disease, as well as mental health issues. The main cause of disruption is from light which confuses the brain’s master clock, this means that you often have to fight aspects of modern life and make sure you protect your sleep by controlling your home environment

      <title>Moment 167: 6 Foods You MUST Eat To HEAL Your GUT!: Dr Will Bulsiewicz</title>
      <description>In this moment, the world-renowned gut-health expert Dr Will Bulsiewicz discusses the relationship between your gut health and overall well-being, including your mental and physical health. According to Dr Will, our gut is like a muscle that we can strengthen by eating a range of diverse superfoods such as leafy vegetables, legumes, and fruit. These high-fibre foods can supercharge your immune system by boosting the production of short-chain fatty acids, lower your cholesterol levels, and stabilise your bowel movements. The benefits of creating a diverse gut microbiome aren't exclusive to you, but in fact, your microbes are later inherited by your children, influencing their future health.

      <title>Moment 166: What Men (&amp; Women) NEED To Know About The Menstrual Cycle: Dr Mindy Pelz</title>
      <description>In this moment, nutritionist and functional health expert, Dr. Mindy Pelz gives the information that every man needs to hear about menstrual cycles in order to better understand the females in their life:
The menstrual and reproductive cycle lasts from 28 - 32 days (this varies from female to female)
Day 1 - 10, is when a female is building oestrogen, Mindy says that for the first 2 days is the best time to give the female’s of your life some space. Afterwards they will be more present and outgoing.
Day 12/13, is when oestrogen is at it’s peak in the female body and is the best time to resolve any conflict
Day 10 - 15, is when ovulation happens and is when a female’s libido is highest, after Day 15, there is a crash of hormones which can lead to feeling low
Day 17/18 is when progesterone starts to come in and is the time to be particularly nice and caring to the female’s in your life until the cycle begins again
Mindy says that understanding the patterns of the female menstrual cycle, can create large amounts of empathy, and men can change their behaviour to help the females in their life as best they can.

      <title>Moment 165: This Exercise Enhances Mood, Memory &amp; Concentration: David Raichlen </title>
      <description>In this moment, leading professor of evolutionary biology, David Raichlen discusses how to boost the brain benefits that come from exercise. Most people know that exercise can improve cognitive function, but don’t realise that different sort of exercise, like cardio or strength training, can provide different types of neurological benefits. David says that whilst all exercise is beneficial to the brain, research shows that the best sort of physical activity is a combination of physical and cognitive challenges. This helps the brain function as it copies how humans evolved to find food and survive. So this could mean that the next time you go for a run, choose the great outdoors over the treadmill and try different routes you haven’t taken before.

      <title>Moment 164: AVOID These 3 Phone Habits That Are Hurting Your Brain! The Mental Health Doctor: Dr Aditi Nerurkar</title>
      <description>In this moment, the world renowned expert in stress, Dr Aditi Nerurkar discusses how the majority of people in the modern world suffer from ‘Popcorn Brain’. According to Dr Aditi ‘Popcorn Brain’ comes from our excessive use of smartphones and social media. This is a real biological phenomenon where your brain circuitry ‘pops’ due to overstimulation and spending too much time online. Your brain never really gets a moment of rest, as being online means it it receives a nonstop stream of information. ‘Popcorn Brain’ is different to the psychological disorder that is internet addiction, as internet addiction seriously affects your ability to live your life, whereas Popcorn Brain defines modern life with everyone being constantly distracted. One of the ways that you can overcome ‘Popcorn Brain’ and improve our mental health is by reducing your reliance on your phone, making sure that you create healthy digital boundaries, so that you give yourself the mental space to live your life.

      <title>Moment 163: Happiness Expert Reveals The One Type Of Person You Should NEVER Date</title>
      <description>In this moment, happiness scientist and expert, Arthur C Brooks, discusses what people get wrong in their search for romantic happiness. According to Arthur, the biggest mistake people make when searching for their romantic partner is looking for an exact copy of themself. This is one of the reasons that dating apps are so unsuccessful, as their dating profile will rigidly select people with the same preferences as them, allowing no surprises and potential to experience different qualities. Instead, people are better off looking for someone who complements and completes them and their qualities. This is why many happy marriages will be between people with different qualities, such as an introvert and an extrovert. These sorts of relationships celebrated their difference rather than partners trying to change each other to be more like them, as Arthur says that this is a killer of relationships

      <title>Moment 162: The ONE Thing Stopping You From Reaching Your Full Potential!: Africa Brooke</title>
      <description>In this moment, world renowned mentor and writer, Africa Brooke discusses how the idea of personal accountability has been hijacked. She says that all too often people can pass up on accepting responsibility and instead blame others for their misfortune and see themself as a constant victim. However, Africa says that the idea of accountability is actually a way of giving power, freedom, and control back to people, as they realise there is always something they are able to do to change their situation. Once they realise this, people gain resilience for future tough times, as they know that no matter the situation they have the ability to control how they move forward in life.

      <title>Moment 161: The Surprising Link Between Your Gut And Your Brain: Gary Brecka</title>
      <description>In this moment, world-leading wellness expert Gary Brecka explains the fundamental relationship between our mental and our gut health. For years people have thought that their anxiety and depression are either all in their head or a product of their environment, however, Gary says the gut is the crucial hub for mental well-being. He believes that our gut functions like an assembly line. If anything disrupts its pace or workings, the wider factory of our body and mind is at risk. As a result, Gary believes that it’s crucial, before anything else, to find out how your gut is working to ensure optimal mental and physical health.

      <title>Moment 159: The Most Important Sex Advice You NEED To Hear: Esther Perel </title>
      <description>In this moment, world-renowned relationship therapist, Esther Perel discusses sexless relationships. In her work, Esther says that many of her patients focus so heavily on the amount of sex they are having, and begin to panic when this starts to change. Instead, she says that they should focus on the quality of the experience, and the connection they have with their partner. Esther believes that many of the issues and concerns around the amount of sex a couple is having can be reduced by having better communication around sex. These conversations include a partner’s fantasy life, what they enjoy, what excites them, and what do they look for in sex. Most couples have never had these conversations before and don’t realise that sexuality is a vast topic that changes with their lives.

      <title>Moment 158: What is The Best Cheap Coffee? Coffee Expert Reveals In Blind Taste Test: James Hoffman </title>
      <description>In this moment, world renowned coffee expert, James Hoffmann, tests and chooses the best high street coffee. James guides you though everything you need to know to assess coffee like a professional, this includes looking at the roast of the coffee, the smell and finally it’s taste and different tones. He also outlines the benefits of supporting your local cafe rather than getting your morning cup at a major coffee chain, as you can get a better cup of coffee from someone who cares nearly as deeply about coffee as you.

      <title>Moment 157: The Money Expert's Investment Strategy NO ONE Is Talking About: Morgan Housel</title>
      <description>In this moment, financial expert and bestselling author, Morgan Housel discusses the hidden costs of everything in life. Morgan says that that anything good in life comes with an unseen price tag, and part of achieving success in any area of life requires putting up with unknowns and volatility. In a career this might be long hours away from your family, in a relationship it may be the sacrifices and compromises made for another person. Part of this is being aware of your time horizons in life, and the amount of time between now and your goal, determining whether you are willing to sacrifice precious time to achieve the goal. In the end, Morgan says that the key to success in life is identifying what the cost is for any decision and being willing to pay it.

      <title>Moment 156: Your Stress Is Making you Fat &amp; Sick... Here's How To Fix It!</title>
      <description>In this moment, neuroscientist and bestselling author, Dr Tara Swart discusses the brain-body impacts of stress and the dangers of being around stressful people. While people think of stress as being solely a mental health problem, it can physical health impacts, the most obvious being an increase in belly fat. This fat is a result of the stress hormone cortisol, which because of evolution, tells your body to hold onto fat as a survival mechanism. Because of this, you can’t shift this belly weight with either diet or exercise, the only thing that will change it is addressing the stress that is causing the release of cortisol. Dr Swart also says that leaders who cannot handle their stress, who she calls, ‘leaky cortisol people’, can cause a trickle down effect in an organisation, causing stress and negative health impacts on the people below them.

      <title>Moment 155: The "Post Date 8" Questions You Need To Ask To Find 'The One' - Logan Ury</title>
      <description>In this moment, behavioural expert and dating coach, Logan Ury discusses the 3 fundamental things to look for in a partner. Too often people have a rigid list of exact traits that they want in their future partner in relationship science this is called, ‘relationship shopping’. This is the idea of shopping for your partner like you would do with any product online. However, more often than not, people end up in a long term relationship with someone who has none of these traits. The reason for this is that while people may think they know what they want, they are wrong. Instead, Logan says you need to date like a scientist, experimenting and constantly changing your hypothesis of what you want in a partner. This can be achieved by using Logan’s 8 questions to ask yourself after a date, the focus of this is examining who are you around that person, and what side of you do they bring out, as this is who you will be for the rest of the relationship.

      <title>Moment 154: The Truth About Quiet Quitting: Simon Sinek </title>
      <description>In this moment, bestselling author and business leadership speaker, Simon Sinek discusses quiet quitting and the importance of expectation management when it comes to work. Simon says that both employers and employees need to be more open and honest about what they want from their professional relationship. For instance, he says that Amazon is very open that it is a very tough and competitive culture, so people can choose whether they want to work in that sort of environment. Equally, employees need to be honest about how they want work to fit into their life, do they want an easy casual job or do they want to push hard and be ambitious. Simon believes we need to treat work like a conversation, previously it has been treated like a speech where workers were told what they were going to do, but now people can ask, why does work have to be that way?

      <title>Moment 153: Happiness Engineer Explains The Exact Formula For Happiness: Mo Gowdat </title>
      <description>In this moment, former chief business officer for Google X and bestselling author, Mo Gawdat, discusses the happiness equation. According to Mo, we don’t realise that happiness is actually very predictable, so much so that it can actually be put into a mathematical equation. Mo says the formula for happiness is: your perception of the events of your life minus your expectations of how life should be. This means, that it’s not specific events that cause happiness, but it is the comparison between the event and the expectation you have in your mind of how your life should be going. As a result happiness is all about perception, which means you have the ability to control your happiness and it becomes a choice that you decide.

      <title>Moment 152: The Top 4 Most Successful Stories From Women in Business! </title>
      <description>This moment is a compilation of some of the most successful women to ever appear on The Diary Of A CEO, discussing the biggest hurdles that women have to overcome on the road to success.

Karen Brady CBE, former managing director of Birmingham City F.C tells how on her first away game, it wasn’t believed that she could have a place in the boardroom and was mistaken for a player's wife or partner. Ever since, she has been driven to show the importance of true equality of treatment for people.

Whitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of Bumble, says that one of the key reasons for Bumble’s success in a crowded dating app market was that it aimed at women and what they wanted, compared to all the other apps which ignored women to focus on male customers.

Trinny Woodall, CEO of Trinny London, says that by starting a successful business in mid life, it proves that age is just a number and that energy alongside trusting yourself and your ideas is everything.

Finally, Reshma Saujani, CEO of Girls Who Code, believes women have been sold the propaganda that they aren’t good or smart enough, and are left doubting their own abilities. Instead, she says that women have to say no and believe that they are deserving of success now.

      <description>In this moment, neuroscientist, Professor Tali Sharot, discusses why happiness is not the most important thing in life, and actually it is just 1 of 3 critical factors for a complete life. Most people think that the meaning of life for humans is to try and find the maximum amount of happiness, however this just factor one. Tali says that the second factor is meaning. Often in your life you do a task not because it will give you happiness but because it gives you a sense of completeness that comes from meaning. Finally, Tali says that we need what is called a ‘psychological rich life’, which is basically a varied life. She says that this diversity in life is absolutely crucial as humans have evolved to have a desire to explore and face uncertainty.

      <title>Moment 150: The REAL (&amp; Usually Unseen) Reason You’re Struggling With Love &amp; Relationships!: Logan Ury</title>
      <description>In this moment, relationship expert and behavioural scientist, Logan Ury discusses what she thinks is the most important part out of all of relationship science: attachment styles. Logan says these styles help you to understand yourself, your previous dating patterns, and who you are attracted to. Our attachment style also explains we are triggered to push people away, as our brains create negative thoughts and look for flaws in a person as an unconscious way of protecting us from getting hurt. However, Logan says that it is possible for 25% of us to change our attachment style. She says this can be done in 2 parts: firstly by understanding your style of attachment, and secondly, by understanding your unconscious triggers you can override them in order to get out of your own way in finding love.

      <title>Moment 149: Why You Are Easily Distracted &amp; How To FIX it! Nir Eyal</title>
      <description>In this moment, behaviour and habit design expert, Nir Eyal discusses how to beat procrastination and distraction. One of the first major steps is being able to master the internal triggers that are trying to pull your attention away. Nir believes that to do this you need to try and understand the underlying feelings behind these urge. As he says, time management is pain management, and all human behaviour is about trying to escape discomfort. Nir says that finding these underlying feelings can be achieved by writing down the sensations you feel just before distraction, this allows you identify them and then reframe them to your advantage. Because, if you don’t master these internal triggers, they become your master. Another major step to beat procrastination is by actually scheduling time to be distracted. Nir calls this ‘The 10 Minute Rule’, which allows you to give in to any distraction in your scheduled time, but only for 10 minutes!

      <title>Moment 148: Guarantee Financial Freedom! The 4 Numbers You NEED To Be Tracking: Ramit Sethi</title>
      <description>In this moment, personal finance expert Rami Sethi breaks down the 4 finance numbers everyone needs to know and what exactly a ‘rich life’ is. Ramit says that most people don’t have even the most basic understanding of money, compare this to other areas of life such as driving, where we need to know the rules of the road before putting a key in the ignition. However, personal finance is actually incredibly simple and Ramit says that the four numbers you need to track are: your fixed costs like rent and groceries, savings, investments, and guilt free spending. From these numbers, Ramit says that he can see what are a person’s priorities and outlook on life. But more revealing is someone’s idea of their ‘rich life’. This is what a person’s life would look like if they finally reached the level of wealth they are chasing. Ramit says too often people’s answer to what their rich life is vague, for instance, saying they want to be able to do what they want when they want, or to have freedom. These answers are so vague as people have never really thought about this question before, but Ramit say they need to think about this potential future deeply and in detail so that they can truly envision it.

      <title>The Brain Professor: "Popular Treat Now Considered Deadlier Than Smoking!", "Alcohol Is Shrinking Your Brain" - David Raichlen</title>
      <description>As humans we have evolved to move, but why are we getting it wrong so often?

David Raichlen is the Professor of Human and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Southern California. His research focuses on the connection between human evolution, physical activity, and health, examining why inactivity leads to so many chronic diseases in the modern world.

In this conversation David and Steven discuss topics, such as how modern exercise levels compare to hunter-gatherers, the dangers of sitting, how air pollution is linked to dementia, and the misunderstanding of just how much exercise it takes to get health benefits.

      <title>Moment 147: Stop These Habits That Are Destroying Your Body!: Mindy Pelz</title>
      <description>In this moment, nutrition and functional health expert , Mindy Pelz discusses how we often treat our body as if it was an enemy working against us and our interests. Mindy discusses how evolution has actually shaped the human body so that it is constantly looking to increase your chances of survival. However, in the modern world we are getting in the way of our body’s natural defence mechanism, and taking actions that are against our own and our body’s interests, this can include injecting ourselves with weight loss drugs and using toxic deodorants, causing larger health problems later in life. Mindy says that in general we seem to be in a ‘evolutionary mismatch’ with our bodies and need to regain trust in them.

      <title>World's No. 1 Exercise Professor: "Our Comfortable Lives Are Causing Cancer", "The Truth About Running", "Hand Sanitiser Is Making You Sick!</title>
      <description>We may have health monitors and fitness trackers, but could it be the case that even with this technology, humans are actually reversing evolutionary progress?

Dr Lieberman is the Chair of the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. His research focuses on how the human body has evolved to be the way it is, he also explores how humans evolved to run long distances to scavenge and hunt. He is the author of the best-selling books, ‘The Story of the Human Body: Evolution, Health, and Disease’ and ‘Exercised: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding’.

In this conversation Daniel and Steven discuss topics, such as if human evolution is going backwards, why veganism is not the answer, how commuting is making you fat and what we can learn from hunter-gatherers.

      <title>Moment 146: 3 Simple Steps That Guarantees Ultimate Happiness (Jay Shetty's Happiness Model)</title>
      <description>In this moment, the podcaster, author, and life coach, Jay Shetty discusses how he believes people can find happiness. Jay says that it can be found in two forms, the sort of happiness that comes from daily habits and a more enriching happiness that arises out of deeper purposes. While most of us know what we can do for our daily happiness levels, deeper happiness that comes from finding our meaning and purpose in life is more complicated and vague. However, for Jay this deeper happiness comes from locating your passion, and more than just finding what you love, using this passion in the service of others, as this brings the most enriching happiness in life.

      <title>Harvard Psychiatrist: THIS Food Is Causing The Mental Health Crisis! - Chris Palmer</title>
      <description>If you want to hear more about ways to tackle mental health problems, I recommend you check out my conversation with Dr. Aditi Nerurkar, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN0_ow76hU8
Too often we think that physical health has nothing to do with mental health and vice versa, but could it be that we have the equation completely upside down?
Chris Palmer is an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. He is also the author of the book, ‘Brain Energy: A Revolutionary Breakthrough in Understanding Mental Health’, which outlines a combined theory of what causes mental illnesses, and that mental disorders are metabolic disorders of the brain
In this conversation Chris and Steven discuss topics, such as how depression and anxiety are caused by diet, the impact of gut health on mental illness, and why mental health problems and rates of suicide are increasing.

In this interview, Steven and Dr Jason discuss everything from  the history behind dieting myths, how insulin causes weight gain, why you don’t need breakfast, how obesity is genetic, and the power of fasting.

      <title>Moment 145: The Alarming Link Between Your GUT &amp; Depression: Tim Spector</title>
      <description>In this week’s moment, gut health and diet expert Dr Tim Spector discusses the power of the microbiome, your crucial community of gut microbes. Discoveries about the microbiome have exploded in the last 10 years and revolutionised the way we see the tiny bugs living within our intestine. Tim sees the microbiome as an incredible pharmacy within us, as individual microbes pump out vital chemicals for your immune system. These chemicals also affect brain function and your moods, playing a vital role in depression, as this is directly linked to the quality of your gut microbes. How do you improve your microbiome? Food plays a vital role in feeding microbes, Tim says the key is to consume as diverse a range of plants as possible, aiming for 30 different types of plants a week to maximise the diversity of species in your gut.

Food plays a vital role in feeding microbes, Tim says the key is to consume as diverse a range of plants as possible, aiming for 30 different types of plants a week to maximise the diversity of species in your gut.</p><p>Listen To The Full Episode Here - <a href="https://g2ul0.app.link/zvl4zqtbtGb">https://g2ul0.app.link/zvl4zqtbtGb</a> </p><p>Watch the Episodes On Youtube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/%20TheDiaryOfACEO/videos</a></p><p>Tim Spector: </p><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/tim.spector/?hl=en-gb">https://www.instagram.com/tim.spector/?hl=en-gb</a></p><p><a href="https://tim-spector.co.uk/">https://tim-spector.co.uk</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 144: How To ACTUALLY Break Bad Habits: Joe Dispenza</title>
      <description>In this moment, New York Times best-selling author and researcher, Dr Joe Dispenza discusses how to change habits. A habit forms when you’ve done something so many times that it becomes hardwired into your subconscious, and is even programmed into the very nerve cells of your brain. So in order to break a habit, you have to break the bigger habit of being yourself. Dr Dispenza says that this change can happen when we become conscious of our unconscious. This awareness can come from meditation, as well as mentally rehearsing changes we want to make, so that we avoid the trap of unconsciously making the same choices everyday. By mentally rehearsing scenarios, this avoids the uncomfortableness that comes from taking a step into the unknown and stops you from being the creator of your life.

      <title>Thierry Henry (EXCLUSIVE): "I Cried Every Single Day", Dealing With Depression, My Childhood Trauma &amp; Fighting For My Dad's Love!</title>
      <description>If you enjoy hearing about the beautiful game, I recommend you check out my conversation with Frank Lampard, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us8n8VBQn_c
What does it take to become a Premier League GOAT and what does it take from you when you walk away from the game?
Thierry Henry is a French professional football coach, broadcaster and former player. He is regarded as one of the best strikers and Premier League player of all time, and France’s highest-ever international goalscorer. He began his professional career in 1994 and played for Arsenal from 1999 to 2007, he is the club’s all-time leading goal scorer with 226 goals. He was PFA player of the year twice, in 2003 and 2004, and European Golden Boot twice, in 2004 and 2005, he retired as a player in 2014 and is now coach of the under-21 French national team.
In this interview, Steven and Thierry discuss everything from Thierry’s family’s expectation of him becoming a great football player, never feeling good enough and always wanting to get his father’s approval, ‘dying’ when he stopped playing football and his mental struggles after the game.

      <title>Moment 143: This Is Why You Can't Lose Weight: Daniel Lieberman</title>
      <description>In this moment, Harvard University professor and best-selling author, Daniel Lieberman, busts some of the most common myths around exercise. For 2 of the biggest myths, Daniel says that they are too simplistic, saying that you must sleep 8 hours a night or that sitting is terrible for your health. Instead, he says that most people do better with 7 hours of sleep a night, (but this can change depending on age and health) also, sitting isn’t bad for you if you mix it up with regular interruptions. Daniel also helps to clear up the debate that exercise does nothing for weight loss. He says the problem is actually that the recommended 150 minutes per week of exercise is not nearly enough, but higher levels of exercise lead to sustained weight loss and prevents regaining weight after losing it. In reality he claim that most of the truth about diet and exercise is more complex than we are led to believe.

      <title>Moment 142: These Daily Habits Are Slowly Hurting Your Lifespan: Peter Attia</title>
      <description>In this moment, longevity expert and author of ‘Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity’, Dr Peter Attia discusses ‘Medicine 3.0’.
Most people in today’s world will die from lifestyle diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. In fact, Dr Attia says that our life expectancy hasn’t greatly increased since the 1800s, medicine just means we don’t die from infectious diseases.
To live longer and better in our later years, Dr Attia says that we need a new playbook, or what he calls ‘Medicine 3.0’. This relies on taking preventative steps very early in life, as the risk of lifestyle diseases compound throughout our life. Dr Attia argues that while doctors practising traditional medicine are very aware of the risk of doing certain treatments, but often ignore the cost of not taking action to prevent future problems.
Dr Attia believes that too often we worry about our health too late in life, when the problems start and the risk of taking action is higher. Instead, he argues, that if we take action when we are younger we have so much potential to change the trajectory of our lives. He says that we should start worrying about our future health now, and should think about it the same way as we think about saving for retirement, if we invest now we will thank ourselves later.

      <title>Moment 141: What Coffee Is REALLY Doing To Your Sleep!: Matthew Walker</title>
      <description>In this moment, sleep expert and author of ‘Why We Sleep’, Matthew Walker discusses the 3 main reasons why caffeine is so terrible for sleep.
Firstly, is that the impact of caffeine lasts long after drinking a cup of coffee. Caffeine has a quarter life of between 10 to 12 hours, which means if you have a cup of coffee at midday, a quarter of that caffeine is still in your brain at midnight.
Secondly, as a stimulant, caffeine mutes the chemical, adenosine, which is in charge of sleepiness. However, the adenosine is still there and builds, so when caffeine leaves your system you get a caffeine crash, which is all the sleepiness that has been built up hitting at once.
Finally, caffeine blocks deep sleep by between 15 to 30%. So even if you are able to fall asleep after drinking coffee, it will be poor quality sleep, and you lose out the amazing benefits of deep sleep, such as: regulating your cardiovascular system, replenishing the immune system, and securing new memories into your brain.
However, Matthew doesn’t say that people should completely give up coffee, but instead the main thing to look out for is how much you drink and the timing of when you drink it.

      <title>Michael Bublé: "I Will NEVER Be Carefree Again!", Cancer Diagnosis, Dealing With Rejection &amp; Being Mr Christmas!</title>
      <description>Most people think of Michael Bublé as the soundtrack of Christmas, yet often overlooked is his unwavering dedication to his music, the personal challenges he’s faced and the mission he’s on.
From summers of catching and sorting salmon on his father’s arctic fishing boat, to earning his 10,000 hours performing songs in the clubs, malls and cruise ships of Canada. Michael has earned his success, including 5 Grammy wins, 15 Juno awards, 6 multi-platinum albums, and well over 14 billions streams worldwide.
Bublé is a true family man, yet his journey has been marked by having to overcome severe adversity, including the cancer diagnosis of his eldest son.
This year, Michael announced the launch of his whiskey brand, Fraser &amp; Thompson Whiskey, created in partnership with longtime friend, award-winning Master Distiller and Blender, Paul Cirka.
This is the real Michael Bublé, you just haven’t met him yet.

      <title>Moment 140: The 2 Minute Trick That Beats Procrastinating For Good: Ali Abdaal</title>
      <description>In this moment, YouTube and productivity expert, Ali Abdaal discusses the power of consistency and how to overcome procrastination. Ali discusses the power of compounding interest, and how small actions over time can snowball into trigger larger rapid changes such as viral success from making a YouTube video every week for 2 years. However, to get to this position, Ali says you have to first learn to love the process, moving away from an outcome based mindset that means success is out of your control, and instead to a view of success that comes from within. To get there first means overcoming hurdles such as procrastination. In order to do this, Ali says you should move away from focusing on a large end goal and instead focus on a series of smaller goals along the was. So rather than worrying about moving a whole mountain, people should focus on moving one pebble at a time.

      <title>Casey Neistat (The Untold Story): "I was a homeless dad at 15 &amp; had $200k debt!"...The Crazy Story Of How I Became The World's No.1 Video Creator!</title>
      <description>If you enjoy hearing about the challenges of being a creator, I recommend you check out my conversation with the creator of ‘Call Her Daddy, Alex Cooper, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knPqBc2qJ8E
There’s carving your own lane and then having over 3 billion people view the lane you have carved, all from the starting point of being a 17 year old teen father living in a trailer park.
Casey Neistat is an America YouTuber, vlogger, filmmaker, and co-founder of the mobile application ‘Beme’, which he sold to CNN in 2016. He is one of the most famous people on YouTube, and his channel has over 12 million subscribers and 3 billion views.
In this conversation Casey and Steven discuss topics, such as:

How life has thrown unpredicted things at him

Having a child as a teenager

Leaving home forever on a school night

Working 80 hours a week and doing anything to support his son

The importance of patience

Why he felt like a scumbag

Feeling as if he was never heard

Why he started making videos

The reasons behind his filmmaking style

The magic of Mr Beast

Why Mr Beast is the most important person in the history of entertainment

How great work matter

The strangeness of fame

Why you need to do something you hate to figure out what you like

Being the definition of success but being in debt

Becoming a millionaire but disappointing the people who got him there

His moment of real darkness

The challenge of his daily vlog

How his daily vlog was taking away from his life

Linking happiness and fulfilment with winning

The only thing that gives him fulfilment

The importance of knowing that nobody gives a care about you

      <title>Moment 139: "Your Inner Voice Is Limiting You!" How To Control The Negative Inner Thoughts: Mo Gowdat</title>
      <description>In this moment, ex-chief business officer for Google X, Mo Gawdat asks the question, ‘what are the illusions that you are living under’? Mo believes, that for all of us, our view of reality is an illusion, and this can often become limiting or imprisoning. Too often this viewpoint of reality can lead to an identity you form that you feel that you have to stick with and cannot break away from. Furthermore, Mo says that for a lot of people, inner conflict comes when your actions don’t match with the inner feelings you have, so you don’t feel as if you’re fully complete. To overcome this, Mo says that we need to find balance within ourselves and that this balance can be broken down to smaller, more manageable sections that you can improve on every single day, as ultimately, this search for inner balance is a constant journey.

      <title>Moment 138: The Power of Letting Go &amp; Embracing the Unknown Bozoma Saint John</title>
      <description>In this moment, the American businessperson and marketing executive, Bozoma Saint John discusses how to find your destiny. Bozoma says that too often people say that they just ‘fell into’ the job or industry they are in, when in fact she believes that this is destiny coming to find you and  that we are constantly creating our destiny. She says that we underestimate the power of letting go of control (which is not the same as surrendering or giving up) as a way of opening up to different possibilities and routes to finding our destiny.  As too often we bang our heads against closed doors, when instead there is an open door that is open on a different route.  To realise this, she says we need to treat our powers of intuition like a muscle, ignoring external voices and opinions, training and growing your intuition to the point where you can have 100% faith in whatever it is telling you.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m-2QhqdlfI
From Trevor to Busta, love of the rap game to global success, and rock bottom to rebirth. This is Busta Rhymes as you’ve never heard him.
Trevor George Smith Jr. or ‘Busta Rhymes’, first reached fame with the hip-hop group, ‘Leaders of the New School’, and began his solo rap career in 1996, since then has released 11 studio albums and received 12 Grammy Award nominations for his work.
In this conversation Busta and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Growing up in the hood

Starting out in music

Becoming an MC by accident

Using rap as a way out of work

Becoming addicted to entertaining and the reaction of people to his raps

Rapping to protect himself

Selling crack at 12 years old

Failure not being an option for his father

His father standing in the way of his musical career

Getting booed off stage early in his career

His mother signing his record deal at 17 years old

What lessons he would tell his kids to reach success

Why you need to be selfish to reach success

His manger dying in 2012

How his manager taught him ever he knew

His emotional down turn

How his whole life was going in a totally different direction

Why he couldn’t figure himself out

Being on steroid pills

How his son thought he was going to die

      <title>Moment 137: Finance Isn’t Rocket Science! The 2 Simple Skills Billionaires Use Everyday: Codie Sanchez</title>
      <description>In this moment, investor and financial educator, Codie Sanchez discusses the first steps in understanding the game of finance and deals. Codie says herself that she is no financial genius, however with her background as a journalist, she is able to right the ask right questions to the right people in order to get the right answers. Through this she was able to infiltrate the world of finance and saw behind the curtain. Codie realised there is no difference between a $100 million deal and a $100,000 deal, all were just slight larger steps up the ladder. To see behind the curtain, Codie believes there are 2 key skills people need to realise: firstly, learn how to do deals, which is not complex but only made to seem complicated through financial language. Secondly, understanding the importance of connecting with the right people, online or IRL who can give you all the information you need about the business you are entering. Finally, Codie believes that we never actually sell anyone anything or convince them to do anything, but instead you connect with what people are already truly feeling.

      <title>Moment 136: 3 VITAL Questions To Ask Yourself If You're Feeling Trapped In Life (Relationships, Work &amp; Financially): Adam Alter</title>
      <description>In this moment, professor of marketing and best-selling author, Adam Alter discusses how to become unstuck in life, work and relationships. The first thing is to understand what it actually means to become stuck, this often means judging whether to keep going with a particular path or to quit. In these instances Adam thinks it is best to think about the opportunity cost of leaving a goal behind, especially as research shows that it is nearly always a good idea to keep going beyond the point where it starts becoming hard as this is where growth happens. However, too often we quit as we view any sort of difficultly as a problem. One of the key ways that Adam thinks we can become unstuck is by simplifying a problem as much as possible, we can do this through what he calls a friction audit. This means knowing what is and isn’t important, what’s getting in the way, and how you can subtract it.

      <title>Moment 135: Master The Art Of Controlling That Negative Voice: Yung Pueblo </title>
      <description>In this moment, bestselling poet and author, Yung Pueblo discusses his mission in raising self-awareness and making people realise that healing is possible. When he was younger he believed that if you were sick mentally it was just something you had to deal with for life, however by radically changing himself through meditation and a different environment, he realised that healing is necessary to living a better life. Over time the difficult moments in our past build up in our mind, and we repeat cycles of thought and behaviour, healing allows us the freedom to escape this. However, Yung Pueblo believes the biggest challenge is that people doubt their own power and don’t understand their capacity, distracting themselves from their emotions. Instead we need to sit and embrace these difficult emotions that make us feel uncomfortable and be radically honest with ourself.

This is all linked to low self-worth, shame and guilt, coming from not being able to give yourself permission to accept that what others made find easy you find difficult. As you will need to change habits your whole life, Shahroo believes that you need to change the conversations you have with yourself, feeling smart, calm and proud of yourself so that you can reframe challenges to opportunities for showing your capacity.

      <title>Moment 132: Triple Your Life Expectancy With These 3 Health Hacks! (Verified By Dana White): Gary Brecka</title>
      <description>In this moment, Human Biologist and Biohacker, Gary Brecka discusses how he tripled Dana White’s life expectancy, and how you can increase yours. Gary describes the President of the UFC, Dana White, as just one more example of someone who had given up on their ability to thrive. This included carrying too much weight, waking up sore and being over medicated. Starting from a life threatening alert on Dana’s blood work, in 10 weeks Gary was able to change Dana’s life around, and by the end of 5 months he was off every medication, lost 40 pounds and said that he had no idea that he could feel as good as he did. Gary says that you can copy these amazing results with 3 simple steps: breath work, connecting to the surface of the earth, and become comfortable with being uncomfortable.

      <title>Airbnb CEO: “IT WAS SO DARK WE NEARLY DIED!”. I Was Lonely, Deeply Sad &amp; Wanted To Be Loved! [INSPIRING!] Brian Chesky</title>
      <description>If you enjoyed hearing about the highs and lows of creating the world’s biggest brands, I recommend you listen to my conversation with Spotify founder, Daniel Ek, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_35cUaU_NA
Is being an artist the secret behind running a Fortune 500 company?
In this new episode Steven sits down again with the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, Brian Chesky.
Brian created ‘Airbed and Breakfast’ in 2007 with his college friend Joe Gebbia as a scheme to pay their rent. Cut to 2020, when Airbnb became a public company, with its initial public offering reaching $100 billion, one of the highest in history. Brian has been named by Forbes as one of America's Richest Entrepreneurs Under 40, and one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People.
In this conversation Brian and Steven discuss topics, such as:

His difficult childhood

Always feeling like an outsider and different

How his art teacher changed his life

The way industrial design shaped his career as a CEO

Always wanting to design his own world

Wanting to escape his childhood

His work addiction

Working as a way of finding love

How success is isolating

What no one told him about success

The need to fight to be connected with people

Why success won't fix you

How Obama changed his life

The life changing impact of one text message

His biggest regret

The impact of Walt Disney upon him

How creativity changes the world

Airbnb initially just being a way to pay the rent

How creativity beats data

Why more companies need creativity and heart

Why company culture is everything

The importance of leaders as examples

How your worst moments define you

Airbnb’s fight for survival

What he learned about true happiness

The world’s loneliness pandemic

      <title>Spotify Founder: “Spotify Was A Stupid Idea!” How A 23 Year Old Shy, Underdog, Introvert, Built A $31 Billion Business! - Daniel Ek</title>
      <description>How to go from the Swedish housing projects to billionaire CEO of Spotify.
In this new episode Steven sits down with the co-founder and CEO of Spotify, Daniel Ek.
Daniel Ek is a Swedish entrepreneur who started his first company in 1997 at just 14 years old. He eventually dropped out of college and founded the online marketing firm, Advertigo, which he sold in 2006 to the Swedish company Tradedoubler at 23 years old. Coming out of early retirement, Daniel founded Spotify alongside Martin Lorentzon in 2006.

In this conversation Daniel and Steven discuss topics, such as:

His childhood in a single parent household

The importance of his mother in his success

Growing up in the Swedish projects

Coming from a musical family

Overcoming being an introvert

His ability to adapt to changing situations

Not fitting in when he was growing up

How his difference helped in his later success

Starting his first company while at school

How people worry more about failing then succeeding

Why effort can’t always beat talent

People not understanding what it’s actually like to be a billionaire

How spare time is now his most important currency

Why the idea of success through University is outdated

What football taught him about business

Retiring at 23 years old

Why he found being rich and successful depressing

How the idea of ‘why-not’ helped to create Spotify

Realising that he had approached his career in the wrong way

How Spotify nearly collapsed 4 times

The importance of culture in organisations

Why you should take the risk of betting on yourself

      <title>Moment 127: How To Build Unbreakable Confidence By Making This ONE Promise To Yourself: Chris Williamson</title>
      <description>In this moment, YouTuber and podcaster Chris Williamson gives his best advice for building confidence. Chris believes that the most important step for achieving confidence is to lead with action. Acting first is more important than starting with positive thinking, as this positivity can easily be crushed by negativity. To being on the road to confidence, you should start with an incredibly small step and easy promises that you will never break. Chris says that little by little these small steps will compound until you have undeniable proof of past actions that you can feel truly proud and confident for achieving.

      <title>Moment 126: How To Master The Consistency Of Achieving Your Goals &amp; Sticking To Them: Nir Eyal</title>
      <description>In this moment, the behavioural design and productivity expert, Nir Eyal discusses how the belief that you only have a limited amount of willpower is actually a self-limiting myth. Instead, using scientific studies Nir shows that willpower is a limitless resource. Similarly, Nir says the single factor for why you don’t achieve your goals is from the emotion of not feeling like doing the gradual work it takes to accomplish them. It is because of this that you quit and fail. To prevent this, Nir believes you should act now with the same attributes and values you would want in your future self, the future you that has achieved these targets and goals.

      <title>Google DeepMind Co-founder: AI Could Release A Deadly Virus - It’s Getting More Threatening! Mustafa Suleyman</title>
      <description>AI is going to change everything, but can we control AI or will AI control us?
In this new episode Steven sits down with AI pioneer and co-founder of DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman CBE.

In 2010, Mustafa co-founded the British Artificial Intelligence company DeepMind. Four years later DeepMind was bought by Google, and Mustafa became its Head of Applied AI. Later in 2019, Mustafa left DeepMind to work for Google, and in 2022 he left Google to co-found the startup, Inflection AI. The goal of Inflection AI is to use AI in order to help humans speak with computers, and in 2023 they released ‘Pi’, a personal AI chatbot.
In this conversation Mustafa and Steven discuss topics, such as:


His strict religious childhood

Dropping out of Oxford University

Helped to found DeepMind

The core goal of DeepMind

How intelligence can be defined as information processing and prediction.

The history of previous groundbreaking technologies

How technological changes come in waves

AI's potential to advance civilisation

What the world will look like in 2050

How AI will develop alongside other technologies such as biotechnology

The race to create more powerful AI

Making AI a tool that works for humans

His aim of creating personal AI

The chances of AI getting out of control

The limitations of AI

How AI could be exploited by criminals

How we cannot have a short term mentality about AI

The responsibility of AI creators

His thoughts on the chances of containing AI

The problems to containing or slowing down AI

The need for a global containment policy on AI

Lessons from WW2 we can use in tackling AI

Rory believes that too many companies are following the false goal of finding the perfect measurement of spending to outcome. This can led to companies obsessing over what can be measured and underinvesting on the things that really matter but are hard to quantify, this can include fundamental targets such as customer loyalty and repeat purchasing. A further flaw in this way of thinking is that all data that leads these decisions comes from the past, which means there is a limit on what big data can tell you about future spending.

      <title>Ivan Toney: I’m Finally Ready To Speak! The Truth About His Football Ban And His Future Team!</title>
      <description>He has previously said that he would “speak soon with no filter”, for Ivan Toney that time is now.

In this new episode Steven sits down with footballer Ivan Toney. Ivan started his football career in 2012 playing for Northampton Town at 16 years old, and 3 years later moved into the Premier League with Newcastle United. After 4 appearances with Newcastle United, he spent the next few years on loan to various clubs. However, in 2018 Ivan began to build his reputation as a top striker when he joined Peterborough United, scoring 49 goals in 94 appearances. In 2020, Ivan signed with Brentford, helping them win promotion to the Premier League in his first season. In November 2022, the FA charged Ivan with 232 counts of breaching betting rules between 2017 and 2021, he was fined £50,000 and banned from playing professional football until 17 January 2024.

In this conversation Ivan and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Finding football at a young age

The brutal playing style of the lower leagues

His father’s belief that he would be a top footballer

The advice Ivan would give to his younger self

When he began gambling

The impact that rejection by teams had on him

His journey in football being a constant climb

How moving to the Premier League changed his mindset

Mixing with the wrong crowd when in the Premier League

Not feeling as if he was given the chance to prove himself early in his career

Taking chances and becoming a top goal scorer

Becoming a father at a young age and its impact on him

Advice that he would give to his children if they wanted to become footballers

Why Brentford is so special and it’s superpower as a team

The mentality that management instils at Brentford

The importance of having self belief

His gambling addiction

How he believes that FA made an example out of him

Why he was not match fixing

His lowest point during his playing ban

Being denied entry to a restaurant because of the allegations against him

Seeing this chapter of his life as a learning moment

How young footballers not being given advice on how to spend their money wisely

The racist abuse he has received

Why he stopped taking the knee before matches

How he plans to be scoring goals in January 2024

This can include everything from eating more fish and less red meat, avoiding brain trauma, toxins and even taking better care of your mouth health. However, for Dr Amen, the 2 most important factors for whether you have a healthy or unhealthy brain is: learning and loneliness.

      <description>In this episode Steven sits down with Joe Dispenza, an expert and author who explores the intersection of science and mindfulness.
Joe’s best selling books, such as "You Are the Placebo" and "Becoming Supernatural" have helped thousands understand the science and the potential of untapped capabilities within their bodies to supercharge their health. His work emphasizes the importance of meditation and mental rehearsal in creating positive change and mind and body ‘cohesiveness’, revolutionising how people can see health and wellness as one and the same thing. If you have been looking for a ‘kick’ to make positive changes in your life, Joe provides not just a method of how to do it, but how to stop making excuses not to do it.
In this conversation Joe and Steven discuss topics, such as:

How to take personal responsibility

How we become addicted to our negative emotions

How to bounce back from personal heartbreak

How to turn destructive habits into constructive ones

How your beliefs are the limit on yourselves

The habit we need to break is being ourself

Your beliefs are your limitation

How you become addicted to your negative emotions

How 95% of what we do is programmed

How habits can work for or against you

How you can recreate your reality

How you can become addicted to guilt

How to show up as the person you want to be

How your thoughts can make you feel sick

How your thoughts can help you heal

How we always wait for something external to change so we can change

 How to be a creator of your life, not a victim of your life

How to teach your body how to feel

How the worst things that happen to you are often the best things

How your mind can heal your body

      <title>Moment 122: The Unseen And Horrifying Knock On Effect Of Dating Apps On Our Society - Scott Galloway</title>
      <description>In this moment, professor and author Scott Galloway discusses how technology has taken over dating and the impact of this. Traditionally, a third of couples met via work, another third through friends and a final third at school, however dating apps have completely taken over the dating market. This change to dating has had dramatic impacts specifically for young men, as the men who are in the top 10% of attractiveness attract 90% of female attention. This has led Scott to the belief that online dating has been great for the top 10% of attractive men, OK for the top 50% and a total disaster for bottom 50%. These bottom 50% of men are effectively shut out of the dating market and can have devastating impacts for society.

In 2004, Sam published his first book, ‘The End of Faith’, this stayed on the New York Times bestseller list for 33 weeks and won the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for First Nonfiction.

      <title>Moment 121: "This ONE Small Thing Makes Me So Grateful That I Cry!" - Fearne Cotton</title>
      <description>In this moment, the broadcaster, writer and founder of Happy Place, Fearne Cotton discusses how we can find meaning through connection in our confusing world. Fearne believes that connection can be found in the simple things, such as stepping outside of your own heads and the constant noise of your life and realising the greatness of everything that surrounds you. The reason that stepping outside of yourself is crucial, is that it removes your feelings of self-importance that can separate you from the connections all around you.

His business failures and what he learned from them

How he rapidly scaled his business

His struggle with depression

      <title>will.i.am Opens Up: “I Would Have Had Children 10 Years Ago!!!” Guilt, Shame, Depression, Creativity &amp; ADHD! </title>
      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with global superstar Will.i.am.
William James Adams Jr., better known by his stage name, Will.i.am began his music career in 1992 when he was only 17 years old and signed with ‘Ruthless Records’. In 1995, Will.i.am’s group ‘the Black Eyed Peas’ was officially formed and released their debut album in 1998. In 2001, Will.i.am released his debut solo album and 2 years later in 2003, the Black Eyed Peas released their third album, ‘Elephunk’. It was with this album that the band started to receive major global attention. Since then Will.i.am has worked as an activist, director of creative innovation at Intel, fashion designer, actor, and coach on ‘The Voice UK’.
In this conversation Will.i.am and Steven discuss topics, such as:

His childhood in East LA

Never having felt poor before he attended private school

How creativity is his currency

Getting a record deal at 17 years old

Why he is living in 2030

Why hard work is actually relative

His thoughts on fatherhood

      <title>Moment 120: The ONE Skill, We Can All Learn, That 95% of Millionaires Have!: Alex Hormozi</title>
      <description>In this moment the entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist Alex Hormozi gives his best advice for becoming a millionaire. According to Alex there are many ways to reach this level of success, but it is dependent upon the person on which path they want to take to become a millionaire. This can either come from creating a business around a core skill or working with other people to combine their skills into a unified organisation. Alex believes that one of the keys to personal development and success is the idea of skill stacking. This is the adding of different skills on top of an original skill, until you reach a level of having a completely unique and valuable skillset.

      <title>Shocking TRUE Story: “I Lost Both Of My Legs Because Of A Tampon” (Health Warning) - Lauren Wasser </title>
      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with model, Toxic Shock Syndrome survivor and activist Lauren Wasser.
Lauren was born into a family of models and started modelling at just 2 months old. She was beginning to make a name for herself in the modelling industry when at 24 years old she contracted Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) from a tampon. TSS is a life-threatening complication from bacterial infections, and due to infection both of Lauren’s legs were amputated. 3 years after being just 10 minutes from death, Lauren made her return to modelling at 27 years old in her now trademark golden legs. She now works to educate and raise awareness about the impact of TSS.
In this conversation Lauren and Steven discuss topics, such as:

The day that her life changed forever

How a tampon nearly killed her

Losing her leg at 24 years old

Her struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts

Finding her confidence again

Her return to modelling

How her golden legs became her statement piece

Finding her purpose in tackling Toxic Shock Syndrome

The information that everyone should hear

      <title>Moment 119: How To Figure Out ANYTHING In Your Life: Marie Forleo</title>
      <description>In this moment, entrepreneur and author of ‘Everything is Figureoutable’, Marie Forleo discusses her 3 rules for a Figureoutable mindset. The most important of these rules is her third rule, which says that if you don’t care enough to reach a dream or goal, that’s OK, and instead you should find another dream or goal. Too often in life we beat ourselves up for being unmotivated or lazy for not achieving certain targets. Actually, we should just admit that we don’t care enough about the goal, and it is just something we think we should want to achieve. Instead, Marie believes we should reexamine our priorities and understand the difference when we say we ‘can’t’ or ‘won’t’ do something, as 99 percent of the time when we say we ‘can’t ‘we mean we won’t or don’t want to.

      <title>Moment 118 - The Ultimate Gift YOU Should Be Offering Each &amp; Every Friend: Simon Sinek</title>
      <description>In this moment, the best selling author and inspirational speaker, Simon Sinek, discusses the honour of being able to serve a friend in need, why people are having quarter life crises and why we should ignore the targets set by social expectations. Simon believes that more often than not when people are in a crisis they don’t want solutions but for some to let them vent and sit in the mud with them. He also discusses how too many young people are worried about wasting time in their careers and life, trying to keep pace with arbitrary targets set by societal standards. Instead, Simon believes we should ignore the noise and stick to our own sense of purpose or ‘why’ in life.

      <title>Moment 117 - The Unexpected Power Of Seduction: Robert Greene</title>
      <description>In this moment, the bestselling author Robert Greene discusses how seduction is a high form of power that can make people do what you want without them realising it. Seduction does this by using pleasure and excitement to reduce people’s resistance to your ideas. Robert also breaks down the qualities of a great seducer, including being outer directed towards other people, a great listener and giving someone attention and a feeling of recognition. Finally, Robert explains why vulnerability is seductive and insecurity is not. While insecurity is self-absorbed, vulnerability is an openness to another person and the world.

      <title>Moment 116 - The ONE Type Of Trauma You Cannot Heal From: Professor Steven Peters</title>
      <description>In this moment, the psychiatrist and author of ‘The Chimp Paradox’, Professor Steve Peters, discusses how there are some early childhood traumas that simply can’t be erased. It is a commonly held belief that with enough therapy and time all traumas can be eventually be eradicated. However Professor Peters believes that it is critical we divide traumas between those you can tackle and others that you have to learn to live and deal with. If we don’t accept that there are some problems that can’t be solved it can actually cause more distress, not only to the people suffering the trauma but even to their therapists and partners.

      <title>Moment 113 - Why You're Not Having Sex &amp; How To Get It Back: Jay Shetty</title>
      <description>If you go onto social media or talk with friends it seems that everyone is having sex, however if you look at the statistics it seems that sex is at an all time low. In this moment, ex-monk and relationship guru, Jay Shetty discusses why there is a rise in sexless relationships and marriages, going for months or even years without sexual intimacy. To bring back sex, Jay says that we need to regain intimacy in relationships, through open and honest conversations, as sex is a byproduct of connection and intimacy, rather than a source of it.

      <title>How To TRANSFORM Your Life At Any Moment: The Alcoholic Lawyer That Became "The Fittest Man On The Planet"!! Rich Roll</title>
      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with the ultra-endurance athlete, bestselling author and podcast host, Rich Roll.

Rich was a successful lawyer until a revelation at 40 sent him down the path of becoming an ultra-endurance athlete, 2 years later he competed in the ‘Ultraman World Championships’, a 320 mile triathlon in Hawaii. Rich finished as the fastest American male competitor, and in 2009 he was named one of Men’s Fitness’s ‘25 Fittest Men in the World’. In 2012, he published his memoir ‘Finding Ultra’, and shortly after, ‘The Rich Roll Podcast’ which has released over 750 podcasts.

In this conversation Rich and Steven discuss topics, such as:

The key lessons Rich has learned after interviewing 750 guests

Rich’s struggle with alcoholism

What inspired Rich to make such a radical change in his life

The benefit of test yourself with difficult challenges

Why you should have a nourished life rather than a balanced life

      <title>Moment 109 - How to Overcome &amp; Push Through Your Hardest Times: John Eckbert </title>
      <description>In this moment John Eckbert discusses how he was able to make it through the darkest and most difficult period of his life and the lessons that he learned that made him a better person and CEO. This period challenged every identity that John gave to himself: a husband, a partner, and a father. However, what remained stable during this time was his position as a business leader and the trust that things will improve, you just have to keep showing up. Looking back, John believes it is important to remember that we end up being grateful for the worst periods in our life, as they end up making us into the people we are.

      <title>Moment 108 - This Powerful Tool Can Change Your Life: Africa Brooke</title>
      <description>In this moment Africa Brooke discusses the importance of accountability and how taking responsibility is the opposite of self-sabotage. From her own past experiences, Africa knows that it is all too easy to externalise and place the blame outside of yourself. This is a way of avoiding self reflecting and truly examining the role you play in the decisions and negative outcomes in your life. However, the opposite is also true that we always have the ability and power to change even the smallest part of our circumstances for the better.

      <title>Macklemore: How I Destroyed My Addiction &amp; Overcame My Darkest Times</title>
      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with the American rapper and songwriter Macklemore.
Ben Haggerty adopted the stage name of Macklemore when he began rapping at the age of 14, at the same time he was beginning his struggle with substance abuse. Ben released his debut album, ‘The Language of My World’, in 2005. However, his struggles with addiction threaten to halt his musical career and he entered rehab in 2008. He started collaborating with the producer Ryan Lewis in 2009 and the pair released their album, ‘The Heist’, in 2012. This album went on to win 4 Grammy Awards and become platinum certified. Since 2017, Ben has focused on his solo career, releasing the album ‘Gemini’ and launching his golf-inspired clothing brand Bogey Boys in 2021. He has just released his third solo album, ‘Ben’.
In this conversation Ben and Steven discuss topics, such as:

Ben’s struggle with addiction and relapsing

How to be there for someone struggling with the disease of addiction

Knowing the difference between what you want in the moment vs in the long term

Removing your ego and being present during the creative process

The double edged sword of social media

      <title>The Scary New Research On Sugar &amp; How They Made You Addicted To It! Jessie Inchauspé</title>
      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with the French biochemist and bestselling author Jessie Inchauspé.
After an accident that resulted in Jessie breaking her back when she was 19 years old, Jessie became interested in the ways to achieve optimal health and wellbeing. Jessie followed this passion in her career, working as a product lead at the genetic health start up 23andMe. In 2019, Jessie started the @glucosegoddess instagram account, which shared data from her experiments with a continuous glucose monitor. These experiments looked at the impact that various foods had upon her glucose levels and the subsequent affects on her physical and mental health. In 2022, Jessie published her bestselling book, ‘Glucose Revolution’ (available to purchase here: https://bit.ly/3AFR4HR).
In this conversation Jessie and Steven discuss topics, such as:

The life changing accident that made Jessie realise the importance of good health

Why Jessie focused on glucose as a measurement for health

The impact that controlling your glucose can have upon your health and wellbeing

How out of control glucose levels can damage both your mental and physical health

The hacks that you can use to maintain steady glucose levels

      <title>Moment 107 - Why Counting Calories Doesn't Work: Tim Spector</title>
      <description>In this moment Dr Tim Spector unravels the myth of calorie counting for health and weight loss. Dr Spector discusses how dieting is not just a simple case of tracking calories in compared to calories, as it is nearly impossible for even professionals to accurately count calories. Furthermore, just as people and their lifestyles are not the same, neither are calories. Calories from either quality whole food or ultra-processed can have radically different impacts on your health. Instead of obsessing about calories Dr Spector believes you need to be focused on the quality of your food. Listen to the full episode here - ⁠https://g2ul0.app.link/uqBbGwMhlzb Tim: https://www.instagram.com/tim.spector/?hl=en https://tim-spector.co.uk Watch the episodes on YouTube - ⁠⁠https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>NastyGal Founder: I Was A Stripper! A Shoplifter! Then Built A $400m Business! Sophia Amoruso</title>
      <description>In this new episode Steven sits down with serial entrepreneur Sophia Amouroso.
Sophia Amouroso is an American business woman and New York Times best-selling author of ‘#GIRLBOSS’ which later became a Netflix series of the same name.
Sophia founded the female fashion retailer, ‘Nasty Gal’ in 2006 when she was 22 years old. 6 years later, Nasty Gal was named the "Fastest Growing Retailer” in America. However, in 2016, the same year that Sophia was named by Forbes as one of the richest self-made women in the world, Nasty Gal filed for bankruptcy.
Since Nasty Gal’s bankruptcy Sophia has founded ‘Girlboss Media’, an online community providing mentoring and support for women worldwide. As well as ‘Business Class’, a comprehensive tutorial course that helps founders accelerate and scale their businesses.
In this conversation Sophia and Steven discuss topics, such as:

How Sophia’s rebellious nature helped her to create an original business

How she regards being an outsider as a superpower

Why as a CEO you only know 10% of what is happening in your company

Why Sophia would never want to be a CEO again

      <title>The Man That Makes Millionaires: How To Turn $1,000 Into $100 Million!: Alex Hormozi</title>
      <description>Alex Hormozi knows all about the highs and lows of the journey to becoming successful. From betrayal, fortunes changing as quickly as going from broke to $20 million in under a year, to using pain and failure as fuel. But one thing that doesn’t change on the journey is strength of character, true relationships and the unbudging will to succeed.
As a first generation American Alex knew the sacrifice that his family had made so that his life would be better than theirs, however he also knew that he had to carve out his own path and not the one his father had laid out for him.
In this raw conversation Alex discusses everything from business to love and everything in between. If you want to know what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur Alex has had to earn the hard way the lessons he now shares.

      <title>Alex Cooper: The World's No.1 Female Podcaster Finally Opens Up! (Call Her Daddy) </title>
      <description>You can call her daddy but you can also call her Alex Cooper. You could call her Father Cooper the podcaster, or you could call her Alexandra Cooper, the head of a multimillion dollar brand. No matter what you call her Alex defies labelling and expectations.
But before she was the media mastermind signing multi-million dollar contracts, she was learning the lessons that would help her become the industry leader she is now. Whether that was perfecting her craft of content creation or learning radical empathy from her psychologist mother, these have all been used in her unmatched interviews with the world’s biggest celebrities.
In this expansive conversation Alex discusses her journey to becoming Daddy. From overcoming childhood bullying and self-doubt, hustling and taking advantage of every opportunity that presented itself, Alex has grown and evolved into the icon she is today and taken her devoted Daddy Gang along for the ride.

      <title>Tony Hawk: The Man With The $1.4 Billion Name! Burnout, Obsession &amp; Regrets</title>
      <description>If you think about skateboarding, there is one name that will pop up in your mind: Tony Hawk. It’s the same name that fronts a billion dollar video game franchise. He has been called the Michael Jordan of skateboarding, and at the height of his career he was so dominant in competition that the real fight was for second place.
But before skateboarding became the Olympic sport it is today and Tony the living legend that he is, he was an outsider in a sport for outsiders. Driven by his love of skateboarding and to prove his haters wrong, he created an entirely new path for the sport and brought it into the public light and popularity it has today.
In this conversation Tony discusses his life’s dedication to skateboarding, the highs and lows that this commitment brings and how the sport has given back to him by teaching him lessons that he has used in both life and business.

      <title>Moment 102 - Why A Job Isn't Just A Paycheck: Barbara Corcoran </title>

      <title>Robert Greene: How To Seduce Anyone, Build Confidence &amp; Become Powerful</title>
      <description>How do you achieve success in the modern world? This is the billion dollar question. Some people would say that you must gain a whole new variety of skills and knowledge to keep up in our fast moving times. Only a few people would say you should use strategies that haven’t changed in thousands of years, as human nature and the game of power hasn’t changed either.
Best-selling author Robert Greene is one of these few people. Ever since he was a child he has been fascinated with seeing behind the polite masks that humans show to each other in civilised society, whilst underneath these disguises we all share a darker side and cravings for power.
In this enlightening conversation Robert Greene discusses his life’s work, from the rules of power and seduction, to mastery and human nature. Robert explores how we can use the lessons of history to succeed in all areas of life.

      <title>The Food Doctor: The 4 Foods You MUST Avoid If You Want To Be Healthy! - Dr. Will Cole </title>
      <description>At some point in your life you have felt how your thoughts and emotions have had impacts on your body, whether that is not sleeping because of stress or stomach aches from anxiety. While we’ve all felt that modern medicine denies any connection between the two and the effects they have on each other.
Dr Will Cole believes that we can’t just separate mental health from physical health as they so obviously affect each other. He believes that the way to heal ourselves fully and not just treat symptoms is to be aware of what we our putting into our bodies, from thoughts to nutrition.
In this revolutionary conversation Dr Will Cole teaches all you need to relearn about wellness and how your body works to become healthier and happier in body and mind.
His new book ‘Gut Feelings’ is available now: https://amzn.to/3ZMzcp5

      <title>Simon Sinek: Opens Up About His Struggle with Loneliness, Love, Dating!</title>
      <description>What is the greatest way that you can spend your time on earth? Or in other words, what is your ‘why’? For too many of us we answer that question by saying all the things that we hope we will gain and achieve, rather than the ways that we help others and make their life better.
As Simon Sinek says there are entire sections of book shops dedicated to self-help but none dedicated to helping others, and we aren’t taught in school how to listen or the value of being a good friend. In fact it seems one of the radical acts you can do in the modern world is to live a life of service.
In this conversation with Simon at his most vulnerable he discusses everything from love and relationships, quarter life crises and why you should never cry alone. As with every discussion with Simon, this will have you rethinking everything you previously thought you knew.

      <title>Seth Rogen Opens Up About His Self-Doubt &amp; Struggles That Nobody Sees!</title>
      <description>Seth Rogen is a comedian, writer, director and producer whose films have together grossed $2.8 billion at the box office. In comedy since he was 12 years old, it’s all he’s ever known, and he’s one of the biggest comedy forces on the planet.
Podcast description:
Seth Rogen is a comedian, writer, director and producer whose films have together grossed $2.8 billion at the box office. In comedy since he was 12 years old, it’s all he’s ever known, and he’s one of the biggest comedy forces on the planet.
Opening up for the first time on the dementia diagnosis that tore his family apart, as well as the toll that bad reviews can do to the people who make films, Seth is a good guy trying to make his way in an industry that famously rewards bad behaviour. He tells us what that’s really like.
For many people, Seth provided the narration for their adolescence with iconic, classic movies like Superbad and Pineapple Express - hilariously mining his own fumbles on his journey into adulthood for comic effect. Now, through his weed company Houseplant, he takes people on a journey of a different source as the supplier of one of the most popular suppliers of legal weed in North America.
Seth’s personal essay collection, Yearbook, is available March 7th: https://www.amazon.com/Yearbook-Seth-Rogen/

Podcast description:
Seth Rogen is a comedian, writer, director and producer whose films have together grossed $2.8 billion at the box office. In comedy since he was 12 years old, it’s all he’s ever known, and he’s one of the biggest comedy forces on the planet.
Opening up for the first time on the dementia diagnosis that tore his family apart, as well as the toll that bad reviews can do to the people who make films, Seth is a good guy trying to make his way in an industry that famously rewards bad behaviour. He tells us what that’s really like.
For many people, Seth provided the narration for their adolescence with iconic, classic movies like Superbad and Pineapple Express - hilariously mining his own fumbles on his journey into adulthood for comic effect. Now, through his weed company Houseplant, he takes people on a journey of a different source as the supplier of one of the most popular suppliers of legal weed in North America.
Seth’s personal essay collection, Yearbook, is available March 7th: https://www.amazon.com/Yearbook-Seth-Rogen/

      <title>Moment 99 - Simon Sinek: The Power Of Your ‘Why’ &amp; How To Find It!</title>
      <description>What is your why? It is the reason you wake up in the morning, it is your value and the thing you give to the world and the people around you. In this moment Simon Sinek discusses how your ‘why’ is formed by the time you are a teenager and is the sum total of your upbringing and how you were raised. Once formed your ‘why’ never changes. But Simon says the thing we give to the world with our ‘why’ is also the thing we need the most, to find this we need to focus less on ourselves and focus on helping others.

      <title>E226: Zara Larsson: How To Stop Caring What Others Think! </title>
      <description>Zara Larsson is an international singer song writer, amassing over 8 billion streams across all major streaming platforms. Since she won a national televised talent contest in her native Sweden aged 10, Zara has always wanted to be ‘bigger than Elvis’ and ‘more famous than Beyonce’. Saying the goal is ambitious is understating it, but she’s single-mindedly pursued it ever since. Chasing the top for Zara is a way of chasing life. Outspoken about her beliefs and uncompromising in her art - for Zara there are no half-measures and no shortcuts. She’s in the game to be the best. Zara is promoting her new single, ‘Can’t tame her’, which is out now. Her new album is nearly ready, too. In one of the most honest conversations we’ve had with a major public figure, Zara certainly doesn’t hold back on how she got to where she is, and where she’s headed next… Topics: Intro Early years Desire to be famous Pressure as an artist Ambitions Life under the microscope Your struggles Being scared of death Public validation Being treated badly by men Advice to people who look up to you Your new album What does success look like for you in 10 years?

      <title>Moment 98 - The One Thing All Successful Leaders Have (And You Can Too!): Whitney Wolf Herd</title>
      <description>With everything that has changed in the world, from the internet to the pandemic, what does this mean for the idea of leadership and being the perfect leader? In this moment Whitney Wolfe Herd discusses how for her a leader is the conductor creating harmony among a noisy orchestra. For Whitney, this means ignoring the examples of past leaders that were more like tyrants rather than bosses, and instead to listen to your gut and lead with compassion. It is only by being open and truly vulnerable that we can connect with the people around us and as leaders get the best out of our people.

      <title>The No.1 Health Expert: The One Food (WE ALL EAT) That's Slowly Hurting Us!: Max Lugavere</title>
      <description>Max Lugavere is a foremost expert on the brain and how we can get the best out of it.

      <title>Behaviour Change Scientist: How I Lost 120lbs With Kindness: Shahroo Izadi</title>
      <description>If your friend tells you about a new goal they want to achieve, would you tell them that there is no way they can do it, or that it wasn’t for people like them? Of course you wouldn’t! But why is it that so many of us speak to ourselves in this way? 
If you really want to change your habits for good, behaviour change specialist Shahroo Izadi believes that this self-talk is what is holding you back from the real change you want to achieve. Instead, Shahroo believes we have to treat ourselves with kindness to create lasting difference.
In this necessary conversation Shahroo breaks down her kindness method and how her own life influenced it, from her work as an addiction therapist to the struggles in her personal life. If you want to change any habit in your life for good, this episode is essential for you!

      <title>Richard Hammond: The heartbreaking conversation that I am STILL avoiding!</title>
      <description>Lying in a weeks long coma after being involved in a car crash at 300 miles per hour, you may wonder about the life path that led Richard Hammond to that hospital bed and the personality behind his miraculous recovery.
From a short school boy desperate for attention to one of the nations favourite trio of petrol heads, Richard has always been either driven or driving. Despite labelling himself just a very lucky guy and thinking success was for other people, his infectious enthusiasm has made him a national icon.
In this wide ranging conversation Richard discusses everything from why Top Gear was the success it was, what he saw on the brink of death, and why cars have always had such a deep emotional appeal to him.

      <title>Moment 96 - Without This You WON'T Find Fulfilment In Life: Stephen Fry</title>
      <description>How many times have you said that you will finally be happy at some future date or when you have achieved some far off goal? Only once you reach that future time or accomplish that goal you aren’t happy? In this moment Stephen Fry discusses how we madly chase for complex things that we think will make us happy or indulge in fake happiness, all the while ignoring the simple things right in front of us that give true joy. Stephen says that our feelings of self worth and fulfilment ultimately come from the way we treat other people.

      <title>Romesh Ranganathan: There's A Dark Voice In My Head That I've Learnt To Control</title>
      <description>From a maths teacher and occasional rapper to one of the UK’s most popular comedians, you would think this was the set up to one of Romesh Ranganathan’s typically deadpan jokes. However, as is the case with most comedians behind the jokes and laughter lies pain.
After bursting onto our screens Romesh has been constantly working always afraid that his success could slip out from under him at any second, stemming from his family struggles as a teenager when his father was sent to prison and life as he knew it fell apart.
In this hilarious but also intimate conversation Romesh discusses the life experiences that have provided him the endless material for his sell out shows but also the challenges that have made him the man he is today.

      <description>When was the last time something took your breath away, or left you speechless? Awe is something that is hard to put into words and understand for yourself, let alone scientifically examine. However this is exactly what Dr Dacher Keltner has dedicated his career to.
As a psychology professor Dr Dacher is dedicated to the study of emotions and happiness, in his groundbreaking research he believes that awe, the feeling when you see something beyond your understanding, can have huge impacts on both your brain and body.
In this eye opening conversation Dacher discusses just what it means to live a good life, our need for connection, and his personally journey from tragedy and despair to finding and spreading the awe of everyday life.

      <title>The Weight Loss Scientist: You've Been LIED To About Calories, Dieting &amp; Losing Weight: Giles Yeo</title>
      <description>Have you tried every diet under the sun but can’t seem to budge the weight, or if you have lost the weight as soon as you stop the diet you put it all back on? What if weight loss had nothing to do with discipline and self control, but your brain was actually designed to want you to be fat?
This is something that Cambridge University Professor Giles Yeo has been researching all through his career, how the brain controls our bodyweight. Dr Yeo examines how our genes have evolved over time to make us crave certain foods, and why people can have totally different relationships with food.
After watching this conversation you won’t see food the same way again, as Dr Yeo exposes why calories shouldn’t be counted, why most diets are the same and unsustainable in the long term and how you can lose weight without losing your love of food.

      <title>David Moyes Reveals The Truth About Managing The Worlds Greatest Teams</title>
      <description>As he would tell you himself, the football is in David Moyes’s blood. Growing up in Glasgow he was surrounded by the game, from his dad coaching to his mum washing the kits, this devotion has continued to now.
Making the jump from player to manager, David has seen every side and evolution of football, and not all of it was pretty. From the highs of being handpicked by the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson as the manager of Manchester United to the lows of his very public sacking, and his miraculous return as ‘The Moyesiah’.
In this conversation David speaks about what it takes to become one of the world’s best known managers, the winning habits and values he instills in his teams and why he is constantly renewing himself for the game he loves.

      <title>Derren Brown: UNLOCK The Secret Power Of Your Mind! </title>
      <description>Predicting the lottery, playing Russian roulette on live TV and tricking people into robbing a security van in broad daylight. These are just a few of the stunts that Derren Brown has performed in over 20 years of pushing the boundaries of the believable.
But while he may be best known for controlling minds, one he couldn’t control was his own. From battling with issues of self esteem, faith and coming to terms with his sexuality, Derren’s path to success has been one that is both internal and in the limelight.
In this intimate conversation with Britain’s alternative national treasure, Derren breaks the magician’s code and reveals his secrets, as well as the psychological tricks we play on ourselves and hold us back from our true potential.

      <title>No.1 Neuroscientist: Age 30 to 50 Will Be Your Unhappiest, Here's How To FIX IT! - Dr. Tali Sharot</title>
      <description>Is the cup of life half full or half empty? Would you call yourself an optimist or a pessimist? What if you weren’t actually in control of this, but instead through the process of evolution your brain had been hardwired to be optimistic?
Neuroscientist Dr. Tali Sharot calls this the ‘Optimism Bias’, it’s the belief that the future will be better, much better, than what has come before or even your current situation. This trick of the brain can effect how you remember the past and how you predict and plan for the future.
In this episode, Dr. Tali Sharot discusses her groundbreaking work and the impacts it can have on all areas of your life, from relationships to career decisions. If you want to understand the mysteries of your brain this is a conversation not to be missed.

      <title>Moment 91 - The "Harmless" Thing You Do That Hurts So Many People! - Richard Osmond</title>
      <description>Imagine being different and self conscious of this difference, then think of how it would feel to be reminded of this every single day of your life. In this moment Richard Osman discusses how he has been body shamed for over 30 years of his life. Ever since the impressionable age of 17 Richard has been made to feel small for his above average height. This changed his behaviour and meant that he held himself back from living the life he wanted to lead. Being ‘different’ has taught Richard about human nature and the hate in the world, but also empathy and what it means to put yourself in someone else’s shoes.

At every step along her journey, no one was going to define her but herself. No matter how many times she got hurt no one could take away the one thing she could control, her resilience. Consistently breaking down barriers and forging new paths, Davina was the first female television host to put her bubbly and occasionally feisty persona front and centre, and she was the first mainstream figure to create a fitness platform that has inspired millions of people to get active in the fifteen years she’s been in the game. 
Having consistently inspired so many people in her life, she dropped by to gift us some of her inspiration too.

      <title>Moment 90 - The Incredible &amp; Unexpected Power Of Vulnerability: Matthew Hussey</title>
      <description>What is real vulnerability? So often when we say that we are being vulnerable we are still giving a version of ourselves that we want and choose to show to the world. In this moment Matthey Hussey discuses the difference between a curated social media style vulnerability where you still have control, and genuine vulnerability. To be truly vulnerable means taking the risk of opening up to the world a part of yourself that you never wanted anyone to see and you cannot know if people will like. But Matthew says the reward for taking this step is huge, as it represents the start to deeper and richer relationships.

      <title>Jamie Carragher: The Untold Story of Liverpool Legend That Pushed Himself Too Far</title>
      <description>There is love for the beautiful game and then there is the all consuming passion that Jamie Carragher has for football. From a top class player to one its best television pundits, Jamie has devoted his life and career to the sport. 
From a working class upbringing as a Bootle boy to “Mr Liverpool”, Jamie has always stayed loyal to his roots and to the city that nurtured and supported him in reaching the heights that his career soared to. However, the sense of duty Jamie felt for his city and its supporters loaded him with a crippling pressure and mental toll. 
In this intimate conversation, Jamie opens the door to a level of sporting achievement that only a select few people ever get to see, discussing both its highs and lows, victories on the pitch and in the mind. As well as the journey from a boyhood fan to the local legend that is ‘Carra’.

      <title>Neil deGrasse Tyson: DO THIS Every Morning To Find Happiness &amp; Meaning In Your Life</title>
      <description>For a lot of people black holes and string theory were topics that were filed in the mental box labelled ‘things I will never be able to get my head around”. However, all changed when Neil deGrasse Tyson began appearing on TV screens. 
Neil’s passion and energy for science is infectious and the reason why he is one of the world’s greatest science communicators. This fascination has lasted ever since childhood where he felt the universe reach out to him at the same planetarium he is now the director of. But while Neil was obsessed with the cosmos he was often brought back to earth, having to deal with racial prejudice and stereotyping as he followed his passion.
In this conversation Neil discusses his quest in raising the global knowledge of space, the universe and the world’s beyond our own.

      <title>Barbara Corcoran: Turning $1,000 to $1 Billion!</title>
      <description>As the original Shark of all 13 seasons of the Shark Tank, Barbara Corcoran has never stopped swimming or hustling. Ever since 1973 when she borrowed $1000 to start her own real estate firm, Barbara’s relentless drive and spirit turned The Corcoran Group into $6 billion dollar business.
Coming from a poor neighbourhood and the second of ten children, Barbara always knew how to scrap and stand out from the crowd. She also knew how to use any setbacks as fuel for success, whether that was being labelled the ‘dumb’ D grade dyslexic student to being bitterly betrayed by her boyfriend.
In this candid conversation, Barbara shares her hard won no nonsense lessons in life and business, revealing how she had no other option but to become an entrepreneur and use everything at her disposal to reach the top.

      <title>Richard Branson: How A Dyslexic Drop-out Built A Billion Dollar Empire</title>
      <description>Told at school that he would either be successful or in prison, with a value of over $3 BILLION and earth’s atmosphere the only thing trapping him (for now), it’s an understatement to say that Sir Richard Branson became a success. 
But behind the Virgin empire and its global offshoots, lies a dyslexic school leaver who never saw himself as intelligent, let alone a business person, who threw caution and conventional wisdom to the wind, transforming from business Virgin to visionary. 
In this invaluable conversation, Richard shares the riches of his hard won lessons and the wisdom that can only come from an exceptional life. For all fans of The Diary Of A CEO podcast, this is truly a life changing conversation.

      <title>(EXCLUSIVE) Billy McFarland: The Man Behind The Infamous Fyre Festival Disaster</title>
      <description>The co-creator of the infamous Fyre festival, Billy McFarland spent 4 years behind bars for lying to investors and using the mythical tropical island festival as a way to pay off his debts. You have probably heard of him from the 2 massively popular documentaries that blew up on social media. 
However, what you haven’t heard is the story of Billy as a childhood entrepreneur, creating and selling companies before he was even able to cash the cheques in his own bank account. A college dropout who moved to New York at 18 with nothing but hustle and drive.
Only months released from prison, Billy brings his still raw experiences to this intimate conversation, discussing everything from the motivation for the festival, his spectacular fall from grace and how he plans to pay back his debts and build back from nothing.

      <title>Stephen Fry: “Lost, alone and I wanted to take my life”</title>
      <description>To call Stephen Fry a national treasure would be underselling him. One of the hardest working names in British media, you name it and Stephen has done it; writer, actor, director and comedian. The size of his contribution to British culture in over four decades as a public figure is staggering.
However, behind this mountain of work and out of the spotlight is a side of Stephen Fry that many people will be completely unaware of, from a childhood of crime and loneliness, to severe mental health struggles and attempts at suicide. 
In this honest and revealing conversation Stephen discusses the scars he carries within him and which affect him to this day. But despite this he is constantly reinventing himself and striving to find joy in the smaller things in life, all the while spreading happiness and wonder with his work.

      <description>Annie Macmanus is a voice we’ve been hearing for twenty years. First as a presenter and tastemaker for the UK’s biggest dance music radio show, as a festival headlining DJ, as host of her podcast ‘Changes with Annie Macmanus’, and now as an author of her best-selling novel ‘Mother Mother’. Reaching the pinnacle of success with a relentless schedule headlining a 2am show in Ibiza every week before flying back in the morning to present her daily radio show, it took the pandemic lockdowns for Annie to realise she wanted something completely different from her life. So she started again. This conversation explores her decision to check in with herself and walk away from a 17 year career at the BBC to explore her passions of writing and podcasts. She presents the challenging notion that your life needs to have a revolution every 20 years for it to remain meaningful and fulfilling. Topics: Early context People please Your parents Your insecurities Leaving Ireland - being rejected why didn't you keep trying?

      <title>Charlie Sloth: From Homeless, To Fire In The Booth, To An £800 Million Business!</title>
      <description>Charlie Sloth is a radio presenter on Apple Music One, and previously on Radio One. The creator of “Fire in the Booth”, he is known as a adept and visionary patron of new artists worldwide. Appearing on Sloth's show is the moment many rappers and musical artists ‘make it’. Charlie wouldn’t have it any other way.
As he reveals in this episode, he has never deviated from his dream of bringing new talent to the fore. Even when he was living in a shed as a single father with a young son, he knew where he wanted to end up. That perseverance got him through the difficult moments, when nothing else would. 
In this conversation Charlie opens up about the need to hold yourself to high standards, because the only feedback that’s actually going to take you to the next level is the feedback you give yourself. In a raw, honest and Frank exchange, Charlie shares his lessons that he’s picked up from a lifetime of hustling, from being a street artist to founding one of the worlds most successful vodka brands - Charlie is never someone to do things by halves.

In a raw, honest and Frank exchange, Charlie shares his lessons that he’s picked up from a lifetime of hustling, from being a street artist to founding one of the worlds most successful vodka brands - Charlie is never someone to do things by halves. </p><p><br></p><p>Charlie:</p><p>Instagram - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbEVUX0l2cktWUTJMU1ZfNTFZQUtTc1FOZGh5d3xBQ3Jtc0ttUXFzQlhSam5Dall6UGFqTGQyRFN3V2c0WU9wUG9jeDRaUXEzRE9YcTVsaHdiTDVWZUx4ODRPSk1FOU56MjJxR1NLSTNwMllZYm5tRV93SGVHLWtkbThmVnJXVEJ6QXY3MmZNS0ZxNmM3U284Y0xkbw&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3u2YD8n&amp;v=pktiT3JVpVU">http://bit.ly/3u2YD8n</a></p><p>Twitter - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqblgwQ0EzUVJlSjNPWnBjWHVwUTZDS3k5OUdOZ3xBQ3Jtc0tra0REUzBFUVBpZWc5bUFaQ1ZCaDUwd05KWjhSb2JXT1J4Qld0cENDakd5U3VwY1h6cWlWMHpyMHFzRWRwdTZFTTJHalNGckFHNTR0cDJHOUdqV2VJdVpKRjh2QXNpTVNKa19EbkdURWZXMHU0bUVhZw&amp;q=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3gDhLqn&amp;v=pktiT3JVpVU">http://bit.ly/3gDhLqn</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p><br></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 85 - How To Speak So EVERYONE Listens To You: Julian Treasure</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment Julian Treasure opens up his vocal toolbox and talks about the importance of paying attention to your voice. While people focus on the content of their speeches and talks, their voice is just as important for every aspect of their life, considering that it is used to inspired, lead, communicate and build relationships. Julian believes that the voice should be treated as a skill rather than a natural capability, something that can be trained, improved and in turn have positive knock on effects for your happiness, health and wealth.

      <title>Louis Theroux: "The Thing That Makes Me Great At Work, Makes Me Bad At Life!" </title>
      <description>From his recent global TikTok fame to his BAFTA award-winning documentaries Louis Theroux has delighted audiences and grown a cult following with his distinctive brand of personality. Best know for his documentary series ‘Weird Weekends’, and ‘When Louis Met……’ Louis has explored the most controversial subjects with wide eyed curiosity and openness. 
In this conversation Louis discusses how his childhood and upbringing affected his career, channeling his anxiety and social awkwardness into his work of exploring the darker aspects of human psychology and behaviour. He also talks about how his work has evolved and grown, from his initial big break in America to his new series of celebrity interviews, and how he has had to balance this with his family life. Just like with his documentaries, in this episode Louis brings his trademark honesty and openness.

      <title>Labrinth: The Musical Genius Behind Euphoria</title>
      <description>Labrinth is a singer, rapper, producer, and composer behind HBO’s Euphoria. Achieving success at a young age, he gave it all up to go to America and start from the bottom all over again. 
This is his story. 
A true independent spirit, after getting frustrated with the corporate demands of Simon Cowell’s record label, he gave up his life in the UK where he had number one albums and an A list life to move to LA, where he was totally unknown.

      <title>Moment 84 - VP Of META Explains How To Get Exactly What You Want: Nicola Mendelsohn</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Nicola Mendelsohn CBE talks about the need to bring your whole self to work. Allowing the space and culture within companies for people to be who they are and know what matters to them leads people to becoming higher performers. She discusses the importance of understanding your core skills and strengths and having an informal ‘board of advisers’ to help you create a stronger vision of yourself. But, while it is crucial to ask for what you want, Nicola believes that it is just as important to do your homework on your career and know what truly matters to you, as no one else is going to do it for you.

      <title>Peter Crouch Opens Up About His Dark Times &amp; Crying Himself To Sleep</title>
      <description>Peter Crouch is a legend both on and off the football pitch. Capped 42 times for England, he is one of the few players to have scored 100 or more Premier League goals. Since retirement he has further cemented his role as a cheeky national treasure with his role as a football pundit and host of That Peter Crouch Podcast. 
But few up to now have seen the man behind the persona. It was childhood bullying and taunts about his height that helped to shape the down to earth man that audiences love today. Using this abuse as his fuel and motivation, he made sure that he let his actions on the pitch do the talking to prove his critics wrong.
This conversation explores his path and drive to footballing greatness, as well as his acknowledgement of the characteristics that led a select few of his teammates from great to legendary. He is a walking example of the benefits and rewards of staying true to yourself, keeping self-perspective and self-awareness, and the benefits of trying to be a good role model.

      <title>Bumble Founder: World’s Youngest Female Self-Made Billionaire: Whitney Wolfe Herd</title>
      <description>Whitney Wolfe Herd is the founder of Bumble and the first self-made female billionaire on the planet. In this episode, she reveals after leaving Tinder in explosive circumstances, the injustices she faced drove her on to build a better kind of dating app. 
A firm believer that the way to connect with people is by being authentic and being vulnerable, Whitney reveals she routinely shares with her staff her struggles with anxiety and when she’s not feeling on top of things. The only path to human connection lies through honesty, and Whitney breaks the mould to be as transparent with her employees as she can.
In one of our rawest and most emotional conversations with CEOs yet, Whitney reveals that she wanted to be the boss not because she wanted to, but because she thought the nature of her character meant she couldn’t work for anybody else.

      <title>Moment 83 - Jay Shetty's 4 Pillars for Long Lasting Relationships </title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Jay Shetty gives his 4 key pillars for long lasting relationships. Jay found these pillars after he says that one of the biggest mistake he has made, and humanity still makes, is chasing what he calls “divinity in humanity”. But the search for a non-existent perfect person with all the answers can lead to insecurity and anxiety. Instead, Jay talks about how every single person in your life should provide at least one of these key pillars and the importance of having them in your life.

      <title>The Man Wrongfully Convicted Of A Murder He Didn’t Commit: Raphael Rowe</title>
      <description>Raphael Rowe is the host of Worlds Toughest Prisons on Netflix, the worldwide-hit show that takes us inside the toughest penitentiaries on the planet. It’s a world he knows well, wrongfully convicted of murder, he spent twelve years in maximum security prisons before he proved his innocence and was released.
In a conversation that goes into more depth about how he survived twelve years in prison for a crime he didn’t commit than he ever has before, Raphael bares all about the son he’s never spoken to, how he kept going against all the odds, what the experience taught him about life, and about himself. 
But what’s striking about Raphael’s story is it’s often the simple things that get us through the difficult moments. A good relationship, exercise, self awareness. Raphael really illustrates how control over basic components of self and social awareness help people survive in even the toughest environments.

      <title>Gabor Mate: The Childhood Lie That’s Ruining All Of Our Lives</title>
      <description>Gabor Mate is a multi-bestselling author and a world leading expert on trauma and how it effects us throughout our whole lives. A holocaust survivor and a first generation immigrant, Gabor’s knowledge and wisdom on the scars trauma leaves behind is deep and drawn from personal experience. 
In a conversation that unlocks the answers to people’s most burning questions about trauma, mental health, ADHD, and the hidden hardwire of our brain, Gabor brings us one step closer to really knowing ourselves and our inner urges. Gabor’s voice, both literally and in terms of what he has to say, is like a balm for anyone who’s mental health has ever caused them worries. Gabor has been through things few of us can ever imagine, and his insights are those few of us could ever have thought of before.

      <title>Moment 82 - Michael Jordan &amp; Kobe Bryant ALWAYS Won Because Of This: Tim Grover</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Tim Glover talks about the tiny differences that make the difference between winning and losing. There’s one thing that seperates the very best from the rest, and it is sweating every single tiny detail. Tim Glover is the man who was in charge of performance for both Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. He sums up Kobe Bryant’s attitude to winning the NBA with one phrase: ‘Kobe Bryant was not interested in winning championships, he was obsessed’. For the top 1%, there is no such thing as letting it slide.

A legend of hip hop and rap who changed not only the dominant sound within the genre, he totally upended the way it operated as a business. In this conversation, he tells his story. Always knowing that he could never work for anyone else, nor could he sell out his business to ‘corporates’, his has been the life of a true ‘independent’, going from one start up venture to the next with only one thing seemingly connecting his wildly diverse businesses: it was what he wanted to do. </p><p>In a raw and frank conversation Damon reveals the lessons he’s learnt from his triumphs and successes, his regrets, his proudest achievements, and the philosophy he’s developed and honed from them all. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow Dame: </strong></p><p>Instagram -  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbUVUR0cxdmVCUE44V0p1dmpjZDRHOHplOHZUd3xBQ3Jtc0trNzByOG5TV0RPcWZkUDEwT2V0eWFuYnExaXRaNnpMdmJUcWFrdTlCUzZfcURTMXlrVFRMX1JwaW95LUIzSVJlc2g0aGFZT2RUQXlXY0FscG53R3BTOTJkSWVJTVprRmRmOUdWcnVPUXVYSHZmU1N3UQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3DVTBQF&amp;v=NpmAsMs_m2g">https://bit.ly/3DVTBQF</a></p><p>Twitter - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbWRFcTJ2elY1UW9KNzJVdzZGUURUV0hOOWtoZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttOHk2N1BGcFdMZzZwcV92ejM2QXl0cHVoS18zNDdXSWoydnlTQ2lxa1FjLUFZVGF0MkVtNjAxZzZlT3llTTI0cHZJZTREa1VEbDJ6bHB3Q3phR0RmVVcxUzZEWGU4cE5rTTE3OGpxVjJfaEpZTXRiWQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F3FFMSf8&amp;v=NpmAsMs_m2g">https://bit.ly/3FFMSf8</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Gabby Logan Opens Up About Her Heartbreaking Past </title>
      <description>Gabby Logan has been on our screens now for thirty years, bringing us the best of the world of sport at Sky Sports, ITV, and for the last nearly 20 years, at the BBC. Whether it’s the FIFA World Cup, the Rugby World Cup or the Olympics, Gabby is part of our memories of these moments. But there’s a side to Gabby people don’t often see. After her brother suddenly died when she was a teenager, she became (in her words) ‘fearless’ in pursuit of what she wanted, knowing that nothing would ever hurt as much again. But she was also wary of loving other people again, knowing what it was like to have those you love most taken away. It took her a long time and lot of introspection and learning to get to a place where she could open herself up emotionally to other people. But it’s when we look deep inside ourselves that it’s revealed who we really are, and what we really value.

      <title> Moment 81 - Malcolm Gladwell: What You Thought About Happiness and Fulfilment is Wrong</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Reflecting on why immigrants and children of immigrants are often more successful than average, Malcolm turns conventional thinking on its head by saying it’s because immigrants make a ‘b line’ for where they need to go. They do this by often asking themselves one question. A question that Malcolm reveals, and explains why it’s crucial. It’s from the big decisions we take, and the big questions we ask ourselves, that our greatest happiness derives from. We’ll let Malcolm explain it from here… Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/rN33bySDtub Malcolm: https://www.gladwellbooks.com https://twitter.com/Gladwell?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Wait list for The Diary - Add your name here: bit.ly/3fUcF8q Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Whoop Founder: How I Built A $3.6 BILLION Company &amp; BEAT Apple! Will Ahmed</title>
      <description>Will Ahmed is the founder of Whoop, the fitness monitoring app worn by LeBron James and Serena Williams, and which goes toe to toe with Apple, Google and Amazon.
Will is the classic example that business and entrepreneurial drive follow on from being obsessed with a problem.  After repeatedly getting injured in his college sports career, Will became obsessed with understanding his own body. He read over five hundred medical papers and realised the product he was pining for didn’t exist, so he invented it.
Will has one of the most original perspectives on how to bring your personality to your business that we’ve ever seen. Employees at Whoop get a bonus if their sleep is good, and the company is ruthless in its priorities to make sure it’s only focused on a couple of things at a time. All of this means Whoop has some of the best wearable tech on the market, despite only a fraction of the resources of its competitors.

      <title>Moment 80 - Bear Grylls: The Trick I Use To Find Confidence</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Bear Grylls tells us how to find lasting confidence. It’s incredible to think that someone like Bear - who’s a veteran of the SAS and conquered every challenge nature has had throw at him - struggles with Imposter Syndrome, but in this clip he reveals his journey to find confidence. Real confidence, according to Bear, comes from accepting that life will humble you, that life is often a battle, that sometimes you’ll lose as well as win. Only then can you appreciate the importance of doing your best, or DYB as Bear calls it. Because really going for things that we want without fear is, in the end, all we can do.

      <title>Christian Horner: The Truth Behind Red Bull Racing's Success!</title>
      <description>Christian Horner is the team principal of Red Bull Formula 1 racing team, which now officially holds the world title in drivers and constructors championships. An iconoclast and a one-off, he was the youngest team principal of a F1 racing team when he took over, nearly 20 years ago. He’s still the youngest team principal today. 
But his path to the top of the podium was not an easy one. Initially turning to team management in a desperate bid to stay in the sport when his driving career was flagging, for a while he was the sole driver, the lead engineer, the marketing and managing director of a veritable racing one man band. Now running an organisation of over 1200 people, Christian is one of the biggest characters on Formula One: Drive to Survive, the Netflix smash hit that has brought an entire new generation of fans into the sport, and the first generation to see for the first time the stresses and stakes of running a team that pushes people and machines to the edge of what’s possible, every single week.

      <title>David Harewood: The Chilling Story Of How A Hollywood Star Lost His Mind</title>
      <description>David Harewood is an award-winning actor, star of Supergirl and Homeland, and best-selling author behind Maybe I Don’t Belong Here, one of the best-reviewed and best-selling books of 2021. One of the best actors of his generation, with honours from Queen Elizabeth to prove it, David’s road to the top had to overcome his psychosis, which at one point drove him to the point of insanity and left him sectioned into a psychiatric hospital. 
With his life as he knew it on the brink, David rebuilt his life and career to reach the very top of the entertainment business. Scars like this take time to mend, and sometimes leave unexpected traces. David is controversially honest that losing his mind, in a way, helped him find his creativity. This isn’t the message that everyone wants to hear, but David’s frankness about how his darkest times set him apart from everyone else is a story you don’t want to miss.

      <title>How I Became The Worlds Best DJ With Only One Arm: Black Coffee</title>
      <description>Black Coffee is one of the biggest DJs in the world, and one of the largest musical artists to ever come out of Africa full stop. Charging up to $300,000 a set, he’s one of the most coveted and in-demand DJs in the game today.
But what people may not know about him is that he’s climbed to the top of the DJ world while being able to spin with only one arm, losing his ability to use the other in a tragic childhood accident. From the greatest adversity comes the greatest achievement, though, and Black Coffee took it as more inspiration to drive towards his dreams - relentlessly, unrelentingly, fearlessly.

      <itunes:summary>Black Coffee is one of the biggest DJs in the world, and one of the largest musical artists to ever come out of Africa full stop. Charging up to $300,000 a set, he’s one of the most coveted and in-demand DJs in the game today.
But what people may not know about him is that he’s climbed to the top of the DJ world while being able to spin with only one arm, losing his ability to use the other in a tragic childhood accident. From the greatest adversity comes the greatest achievement, though, and Black Coffee took it as more inspiration to drive towards his dreams - relentlessly, unrelentingly, fearlessly.

Getting a strong sense of culture in those teams is no easy task, but in this moment Greg breaks it down step by step. Greg explains how he wanted his team to be known for ‘Empathy, Curiosity, and Courage’, guided by the philosophy of seeing what others could see, but finding what they couldn’t. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/sxP6K2iUJtb Greg: hhttps://www.instagram.com/ghoff70/ https://mobile.twitter.com/g_hoffm Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Alex Scott: I’ve Never Told The FULL Truth About My Past</title>
      <description>Alex Scott is a television personality and former professional football player. With 140 England caps, she’s one of the best players this country has ever produced.
But there’s another side to Alex that she’s kept secret up to now. Because Alex’s early life was not one of safety or security. She’s bravely decided to speak up about the trauma of her abusive father, and how that has shaped her mentality to this day. 
It’s never easy to admit something like this, and Alex Scott’s honesty in this conversation is courageous. It’s the same courageousness Alex has shown every day of her life, to achieve incredible things, no matter where she’s from, or what she’s overcome.

      <title>Maisie Williams: The Painful Past Of A Game Of Thrones Star</title>
      <description>Maisie Williams is one of the biggest actors in the world today. One of the breakout stars of Game of Thrones, Maisie hasn’t known a normal life since she was 11 years old when she was cast in the biggest tv show in the world. 
In this pathfinding and boundary-breaking conversation, Maisie reveals for the first time just how hard her start in life was. Even close to home, she had to overcome those who didn’t believe in her, and has had to battle through mental health issues ever since.
Few journeys we’ve seen of people being able to define and find meaning in their own life despite those who doubt them are as inspiring as the one we’ve seen with Maisie. We are so proud of Maisie for bringing courage and honesty to the table today. It’s nothing less than the norm for her, because she’s shown courage and honesty all her life.

      <title>Moment 76 - The Number One Cause Of Anxiety Today: Tom Bilyeu</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Tom Bilyeu walks us through how his struggles with anxiety have actually brought him to a place where he enjoys life to the fullest. He walks us through how he breaks his 'rehearsal of failure' and the worries that plague his head through meditation. Sometimes it takes issues in our life for us to see our position in most perspective. For Tom, his mental health battles are what made him sort out his diet, and get into a clear space in his own mind about what mattered to him. And when you have clarity, you can take action. When you take action, things change for the better.

      <title>The Speaking Expert: How To Speak So Everyone Hears You: Julian Treasure</title>
      <description>Julian Treasure is a prolific author who is the world-leading expert on how to make yourself heard and be an engaged and empathetic listener. One of the most popular Ted speakers of all time, his talk ‘How to Speak So People Want to Listen’ has been viewed over 50 million times. 
When Julian speaks, people listen. And what we learned from Julian is that listening and speaking isn’t a simple case of give and take, one person speaking and another one listening. Instead, it’s a circle, the way one person talks effect the way the other person listens, and vice versa. 
We also learn the ‘leeches’, or common mistakes, that hold people back from effective and clear communicating. Do you think you’re a good listener and speaker? If you sub-consciously answered yes, there might be a crucial skill that you’re missing…

      <title>Mel C: The Harsh Reality Of Being In The World’s Biggest Girl Band</title>
      <description>Mel C is a singer and ‘Sporty Spice’ from the Spice Girls, through her solo career and her time with the Spice Girls she’s sold over 100 million records, making her one of the best selling musical artists of all time.
Every single one of those records was against the odds of coming from a council estate near Liverpool, derogatory labels in the press calling her ‘Sumo Spice’, and music industry management that didn’t believe in her and sought to objectify her.
But she persevered and helped to build the biggest girlband of all time, as well as one of the most successful solo careers of any group member ever. The world is so glad she did because, as this conversation shows, she has so much to contribute when she’s let free to do things her way.

      <title>Moment 75 - What You Think You Know About Money Is Wrong: Mo Gowdat</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment Mo Gawdat lays out a philosophy for how to admit when you’re wrong, and the right way to go about setting priorities in your life. As Mo powerfully says, ‘50% of what I know is wrong’, and this is true for everyone. Coming to life from this position of humbleness is the only way we can truly get our head straight on what our life is and where it’s taking us. There are things that you need, like food and human interaction, and there are things that you want, like status or expensive possessions. Interrogating the insecurity in our wants and why we really want them is the best way to be at peace with ourselves, and to cut out toxic habits from our life. Because as Mo never tires of pointing out, it’s not how much money we have, but what amount of money we’re happy with, that counts. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/4GuqQfBYltb Mo: https://www.solveforhappy.com https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat/?hl=en Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Lewis Capaldi: The Untold Story Of Becoming A Global Superstar At 22 </title>
      <description>Lewis Capaldi is one of the biggest singers and musicians in the world today whose last album went 4x platinum. His new single is Forget me and it’s out now. Known for his authentic and honest style, Lewis is unlike any poster that’s come before him.
But behind the everyman ‘boy from Glasgow’ persona is a vulnerable side to Lewis. After a 3 year hiatus from music he tells us, for the very first time, he opens up about his struggles with sometimes crippling anxiety, how he ‘hates recording albums’, and the intense pressure he puts himself under that drives everything he does.
This conversation is a hell of a ride. Expect what you thought you knew about Lewis to be turned upside down. But in the process of listening to this conversation with the pop star whose persona is that he has nothing to hide, you’ll see just how much he’s been holding back all this time.

      <title>Chris Kamara: The Untold Heartbreaking Story Of A Football Legend</title>
      <description>Chris Kamara is a former professional footballer and pundit who lit up our screens as part of Sky Sports punditry team for 25 years before he left Sky this year. He now has a podcast, Kammy and Ben’s Proper Football podcast.
But there’s more to Chris than meets the eye. Behind the cheery facade is someone who’s had to overcome an incredibly hard start in life, from being one of the few black kids in his area to his family at times having to resort to beg for food. After a diagnosis with Asphyxia, he is one of the most high-profile people with the disease.
Chris has always managed to look for the positives in life no matter what it throws at him. A self-described ‘people person’, despite going through experiences most of us can only imagine he’s always found his glass half full. And if he can, any of us can.

      <title>Moment 74 - Business Struggles That No One Tells You: Payal Kadakia</title>
      <description>In this moment, Classpass founder Payal Kadakia takes us inside the mental dilemmas and burdens of running a billion dollar business. Because when you’ve built a global company from nothing, no matter how big it gets you always remember when it was small, vulnerable, and struggling. You’ll always see the tiny company it used to be, not the behemoth it’s become. Payal freely admits to paying a heavy price of being too wary of this fear. She missed birthdays, lost friends, and severely effected her mental health. It took a lot of maturing and growing for Payal to achieve balance, balance between her work life and her home life, but also balance between what she wanted, and what she knew she needed.

      <title>4 Moments On The Diary Of A CEO That Changed My Life</title>
      <description>This week, we’re going to do something a little different, offering up four pearls of wisdom from our guests on how to find more connection in your life. Connection with other people, but also a better connection with yourself, what you really want, and what’s really good for you.
These four incredible snippets from Mo Gawdat, Africa Brooke, Bear Grylls and Mel Robbins together offer inspiration on how to break through the mental barriers holding you back to feel more present in the moment and be clearer with yourself and others about your needs and desires. When a guest steps into the kitchen and sits themselves down, they’re not just appearing on a podcast, they’re joining the Diary of a CEO community.
Every single conversation adds new dimensions of truth, honesty, wisdom and integrity. By bringing these four passages together, it shines new light on the individual value of them all, but it also helps us understand the journey we’re all on together in more perspective.

By bringing these four passages together, it shines new light on the individual value of them all, but it also helps us understand the journey we’re all on together in more perspective. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo"><strong>﻿</strong>https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 73 - Simon Sinek: How To Find Ultimate Fulfilment At Work</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Simon Sinek talks about how we can find purpose in our lives through attaching it to causes bigger than ourselves. There are things that we can achieve by ourselves, but true satisfaction and real pride in our achievements always comes from being part of a team or a collective. A wider cause or a group we care about is the only thing that would cause us to make real sacrifices. Simon’s thought long and hard about how we can take projects in the workplace and in our social lives and infuse them with real meaning for everyone involved with them. What’s emerged is a profound meditation on where human satisfaction really comes from, and a step by step guide on how to bring these principles into your life.

      <title>James Smith: Become Confident In 100 Minutes</title>
      <description>James Smith is a fitness influencer and the two-time best-selling author of Not a Life Coach and Not a Diet Book. His no holds barred approach to fitness advice makes him unlike any other fitness influencer today, and now he’s bringing his unique philosophy to improving people’s confidence.
According to James, we’ve been getting self confidence and how to achieve it all wrong. Confidence is not a surefire belief in ourselves to achieve great things, but rather confidence is being at peace with the idea of losing or things going wrong. When you know it isn’t the end of the world, you realise losing isn’t the same as being defeated.
Like James’ brutally honest fitness advice, there’s no quick fix to confidence, or any miracle cure. James starts, like he always does, by looking at himself honestly - and truthfully - in the mirror, and all he asks is we do the same as well. James’ book is out today.

      <title>Pret &amp; Itsu Founder: How I Built TWO Billion Dollar Brands At The Same Time!: Julian Metcalfe</title>
      <description>Julian Metcalfe is the founder of Pret A Manger and Itsu, and since he’s been a young man has been on a mission to change the way we think about eating out and how we eat. His companies are together worth over $3 billion.
But he’s also been on a mission to prove something to himself after the suicide of his mother and a life threatening car crash when he was still young uprooted his life as he knew it. Like all founders, he chose the long road back to being secure in himself.
Julian spews with original thoughts on how to really take a company from zero to $1 billion+, from hiring and firing to knowing when to take the leap to expand your brand. Business is a game of thousands of little decisions, a few really big ones, and a hawks eye for knowing when to pounce. Few people we’ve encountered on the podcast had such a good gut instinct as Julian, nor were so good at articulating exactly how they did it.

      <title>Growing A 10+ Million Youtube Following At The Age of 22: Joe Sugg</title>
      <description>Joe Sugg is an influencer who, after breakout success before he turned 21, decided to dial down the parties and temptations of fame in order to return to nature and make everything more low key.
After realising he didn’t enjoy his life as much as he was supposed to, some serious prioritisation about what his real values were and what really mattered to him was in order in order to refocus and rebalance his life. He hasn’t looked back since.
Joe’s new book Grow is out on the 15th September, it goes through the lessons he’s learnt and the strategies he’s adopted to help him find balance and harmony with his life.

      <title>Making $100 Million A Year Eating Raw Liver: Liver King</title>
      <description>The Liver King is an illusive internet sensation who says the secret to a healthy and happy life is to eat raw meat every day. An advocate of what he calls an 'ancestral lifestyle', we have to return to the lifestyle our hunter-gatherer forebears. 
Returning to this way of living is most consistent with our DNA and what we're genetically coded to want according to the Liver King. A controversial figure, his advocating of this diet is disputed by many nutritionists, but the Liver King says it has transformed his life, that of his family, and his followers who take up his suggestion.
In this raw interview the Liver King opens up on criticism and his sometimes crippling anxieties for the first time, as well as how his ancestral lifestyle shapes his bond with his wife, the Liver Queen. It isn't always easy to be the king.

      <title>Gary Neville: From Football Legend To Building A Business Empire</title>
      <description>Gary Neville is a broadcaster, serial business founder and owner, and a winner of every possible club football title in his 20 years playing for Manchester United - with 2 Champions League medals, 8 Premier League medals, 3 FA Cup medals, a Club World Cup medal, and 2 League cup medals.
In one of his most emotional and heartfelt interviews to date, Gary opens up about precisely what drove him and his similarly successful siblings on - his brother is the England-capped footballer Philip Neville, while his sister is the former Head Coach of England Netball, Tracey Neville - despite their very humble origins.
A legend of Manchester United and a former captain of the club, he goes into detail about precisely what made the team culture of the Sir Alex Ferguson years so strong, why its so sorely lacking now, why he’s felt the need to speak out more on social and political issues, and why everything he does is for the city he grew up in and calls home. Even after all these years, he’s still bringing glory back to Manchester.

      <title>VP Of Meta: Running A Trillion Dollar Business With An Incurable Illness: Nicola Mendelsohn</title>
      <description>Nicola Mendelsohn is Meta’s (formerly Facebook) global head of advertising and routinely tops lists “most powerful person in UK tech. She’s juggled her high flying career with having a rare type of blood cancer since 2016. That cancer is just one of the things that has held Nicola back, but, like her struggle against racial prejudice in her early years, she hasn’t let it define her. No one is ever going to get to define Nicola except her.
In this candid chat about how she’s seen her role and her company change as it’s come under increasing criticism in the last few years, Nicola holds nothing back on her critics, her fears, her highs, her lows, and what she still wants herself and the company to achieve.

      <title>Moment 70 - How Jonny Wilkinson Made It To The Top </title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week’s moment is all about passion. Where to find it, how to nurture it, and how not to be afraid of it. Far too many people are afraid of just following their instincts to what makes them happiest and most fulfilled. Jonny Wilkinson doesn’t have time for any of that, or for following the expectations other people set. Jonny is interested in what makes you unique, and he thinks you should be too. Jonny’s also got a word of warning, though, because your real self is who you are when you’re alone with your own thoughts. And Jonny’s weren’t happy. He scaled as high as it’s possible to go in world rugby, but he found the process demoralising, and he wasn’t happy. It took Jonny a long time to find a way to be happy in his passion, but that makes his journey all the more interesting, and his advice for your journey all the more profound too.

      <title>Building A Business Empire WITHOUT ANY Marketing: Five Guys CEO: John Eckbert </title>
      <description>John Eckbert is the CEO of Five Guys in Europe. By far the most successful ‘posh burger’ chain in Britain, John tells us how he took a classic concept to a whole new content by inventing a unique business model.
Five Guys in Europe is not just a franchise, but John rather started from zero on a joint venture which has so managed to eclipse the dozens of other similar businesses that launched at the same time, and then some.
As well as dishing out profound business and management advice, John walks us through how a sea-change in his personal life left him feeling trapped and alone. But John fought fires at both home and work in order to make Five Guys what it is today. We’re so glad he did.

      <title>The More Successful You Are The Longer You’ll Live: Will Storr</title>
      <description>Will is an author who brings out the unexpected ways that we’re vulnerable, and how to manage those vulnerabilities and turn them into strengths. The author of six books including Sunday Times bestsellers, he’s one of the most interesting voices on how we can manage our worst impulses to succeed in the modern world.
In a conversation that covers everything from are we more narcissistic than we used to be to how a desire for status underpins all of our ambitions, to how to deal with low self esteem and suicidal thoughts, Will held nothing back on this unfiltered exploration of the surprising strategies we can employ to deal with the dark sides of life.
Will’s new book, The Status Game, is out now in the UK and in the US on the 23rd August.

      <title>Moment 69 - People Pleasing Is Hurting You: Lewis Howes</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Lewis Howes lays down exactly why you need to stop being a people pleaser if you want lasting and deep relationships. What Lewis teaches us is that real relationships come from someone loving us for who we are, not from who we’re pretending to be. Any act or pretence we put on about ourselves will inevitably get found out. So you have to come as yourself, for better and for worse. How do you find an authentic way to express your true self? Let Lewis explain… Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/lPEJbP9Xdsb Lewis: https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/?hl=en https://twitter.com/LewisHowes?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <itunes:summary>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Lewis Howes lays down exactly why you need to stop being a people pleaser if you want lasting and deep relationships. What Lewis teaches us is that real relationships come from someone loving us for who we are, not from who we’re pretending to be. Any act or pretence we put on about ourselves will inevitably get found out. So you have to come as yourself, for better and for worse. How do you find an authentic way to express your true self?

      <title>James Bay: Imposter Syndrome, Trauma &amp; Controlling The Voice In Your Head</title>
      <description>James Bay is a BRIT-award winning musician who’s sold over 5 million records, and one of the most personal and authentic artists working in the field today. Never afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve in his work, his artistry has helped millions of people articulate feelings in their own heart of love, regret, and friendships made and ended.
He’s definitely come a long way from the small town where he grew up, which he escaped through grasping every opportunity that came his way. There’s perhaps no industry tougher to succeed in than music, and this fear that there’s only a few that make it has haunted him at every step.
So settle down and let James walk you through every step of what the creative process looks like at the elite level - where inside him it comes from, what inspires it, and how he delivers his music. James’ new album ‘Leap’ is out now.

      <title>The Marketing Secrets Apple &amp; Tesla Always Use: Rory Sutherland</title>
      <description>Rory Sutherland is the author of Alchemy, a senior advertising executive, and the man who understands why some ideas connect with people and some ideas don’t. He’s a columnist, an innovator and a trailblazer in the world of marketing and advertising.
Rory doesn’t have time for business platitudes, but rather looks for the unconventional crazy ideas that really stand out. This is why he devoted years of his life to looking at business from a human behavioural perspective, to understand not just why people should do things, but why they actually do them.
Rory always seeks out the outlier and the unexplainable phenomena. He’s become an expert on why certain emotional triggers cause us to behave irrationally, how you can be aware of yourself when you aren’t making smart decisions, and how you can deploy those triggers when you’re trying to sell something yourself. Rory blessed us with his one of a kind knowledge to make this one of the most memorable conversations we’ve had with an author for a while.

Topics:

The concept of how we value things

Recursive Trends

The brain's marketing function: Signalling

technology making location irrelevant

making something bad to give it value

Scarcity of product

personalisation

how to deliver a product to the world

Why business are focusing on the wrong thing

Personal branding

Why do you think you successful

The last guest question

      <title>Moment 68 - Do This If You Don’t Like Your Job: Marcus Buckingham</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Marcus Buckingham, is one of the world's most in-demand career experts and the author of several best-selling business books focusing on strengths versus weaknesses, how to take feedback, how to love your work and identify leadership. In this moment I talk to Marcus about how we are supposed to build a great career that we love. The three main question points we all ask ourselves when we are in a working role is the ‘who’, the ‘what’ and the ‘why’. The ‘why’ is so important to think about - why are you doing doing what you are currently doing, why do you believe in the purpose of what you are doing? The ‘who’ is also crucial. Working with people you like, being in a great team, and amongst inspiring people plays a powerful role in our work. But for Marcus, the ‘what’ trumps the ‘who and ‘why’. What are the activities and roles you are actually doing? What do you love about them?  Marcus has a theory about the different threads our days are made up of. These threads ultimately create the fabric of a work day; layers, structures, colours, textures, which can be interpreted into feelings, highs, lows, loves and loathes. The most successful people are able to identify what threads work well for them. In order for this to happen, we need an early framework and a sense of shared understanding about what we naturally lean into, our passions and skills. If we start early on the right threads from a younger age, we will be able to create a career that we love.

      <title>Krept: From Rapper To Building A £17.5 Million Baby Business!</title>
      <description>Krept is a rapper and one half of the the iconic rap duo Krept and Konan. The host of the Rap Game, Krept is a star of our tv screens as well as the recording studio. And with his multiple business successes, Krept has built empires from scratch in multiple areas of his life.
It’s a world away from experiencing crime and poverty as a young boy. Krept has routinely looked into the darkest areas of his psyche to find the motivation to propel himself forwards, finding unexpected truths about the human condition in the process.
Krept’s been stabbed, had to pull his business back from the suicide of his partner, and built his way out of Croydon. There’s so many times in his life where he’s had to bounce back after unimaginable setbacks. But he did it. In full context and with frank honesty, he tell us exactly how he did it.

      <title>Soho House Founder: How I Built The World’s Most Exclusive Club: Nick Jones</title>
      <description>Nick Jones is the founder of Soho House, the worldwide exclusive private members club worth an incredible $2.8 billion. He’s rewritten the rulebook on hospitality, and his business covers restaurants, hotels, events, and so much more!
If you want to know not just how to build a business, but invent a whole industry, this is the conversation for you. If you want to know how to maintain worklife balance while making billions, this is the mentoring you needed to hear.
Nick is so calm and collected in his thoughts it’s strange to think it all came so close to crashing down, and his business was born out of his first initial business failure when he had nowhere else to turn. Because when you get knocked down, sometimes that forces you to come back in a whole new way.

      <title>Moment 67 - The HIDDEN Power of REGRET: Daniel Pink</title>
      <description>In this Moment Daniel Pink opens up on how we can turn regret into our superpower. There is no emotion as forceful or driving to us as that niggling feeling when we didn't get it right. Rather than shut out or deny that emotion, Daniel takes us through step-by-step how we can turn the tables on our own regrets to make sure that we don't make the same mistakes again. Daniel brought such a positive attitude to this recording that our mistakes are opportunities for learning and a teachable moment, not burdens that have to dog us for the rest of our lives. Seeing the hidden power of regret is to realise everything is fixable, mendable and figure out-able.

      <title>Coinbase Founder: The Crazy Journey Of Building A $100 Billion Company: Brian Armstrong</title>
      <description>Brian is the co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, a company thats reached highs of a valuation of $100 billion. After an adolescence and youth searching for independence where no one could be his boss, he’s come a long way, but he’s realised he’s had to change a lot too.
Before anyone had heard of Bitcoin, there was Coinbase. Taking a punt on an industry no one knew and no one understood, Brian quit his lucrative career to be his own man. No one encouraged him. No one. He’d told the idea to hundreds of people before someone told him it could work.
In this conversation, Brian brought a wisdom and a nuance about how to run and build a business like very few conversations we’ve had on this podcast. If you want to know how the best in the world take an idea from drawboard to $100 billion, this is the story of how it happened.

      <title>Moment 66 - Karren Brady's Secret To A Long Lasting Relationship</title>
      <description>In this moment, Karren Brady tells us about how she finds balance in all parts of her life, juggling leading a premier league club with relationships. There is no more relentless entrepreneur than Karren, and no one who works as hard, but there's also no one who cares about their family more. Karren opens up about how constant communication and compromise allows both her and husband the space and the breathing room to live their lives to their fullest potential. Both of them have been so successful because both of them want the other to be successful, and this generosity of spirit is something we can all bring to our own lives.

      <title>Victimhood &amp; Self-sabotage Is Destroying The World In 2022: Africa Brooke</title>
      <description>Africa Brooke is a speaker and podcast host, who has built a community that has helped hundreds of thousands of young people navigate the unique pressures of the world today. From binge drinking to cancel culture, sexual empowerment to race and politics - Africa isn’t afraid to speak completely honestly and frankly about anything. 
No one has come in to speak to us with as much honesty and vulnerability as Africa. This is a one-of-a-kind conversation that left us speechless. There's never a topic on Diary of a CEO that’s off-limits, we will always bring you the world’s leading people telling their honest truth. What to make of their opinions is up to you, but as soon as Africa walked through the door of my kitchen to record, any pre-conceptions of what she was about to say were left on the other side. She certainly didn’t hold anything back.

      <title>Chris Eubank Jr. Opens Up About His Grief, Living In His Father’s Shadow &amp; His Future</title>
      <description>Chris Eubank Jr. is a boxer on his way to being the best in the world. A journey into boxing like no other, Chris didn’t just have to step out of the shadows of his own demons to make his name in the ring, but out of the shadow of his own father.
But Chris’s journey to the top hasn’t been seamless. He’s been knocked back by some bruising defeats, and - as he explains - by tragedy. When his brother tragically died of a heart attack, Chris’s world almost fell apart.
But it isn’t how you get knocked down, it’s how you get back up. Over and over again in Chris’s life, he’s had to look deep within himself to find his inner strength to match his outward toughness. It hasn’t been easy for him, but he wouldn’t have had it any other way.

      <title>Moment 65 - Jimmy Carr On Knowing You're Enough</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Jimmy Carr walks us through how exactly to find out what it is that's going to bring you happiness, and how to find satisfaction in your life. He tells us exactly how to interpret your actions and interrogate your feelings to bring out your true desires. It took Jimmy a long time to find out what he really wanted from life, and he was nearly trapped by the expectations he and other people put on himself when he felt himself moving towards a corporate life he didnt want. Jimmy set himself free, and in this moment he explains how you can set yourself free too.

      <title>Michael Pollan: How To Change Your Mind</title>
      <description>Michael Pollan is an author who between his five bestsellers has sold millions of books. Through exploring our connection to the natural world, he reveals sides of ourselves that we never knew we had. As an author and a journalist, it’s Michael’s job to question everything.
But in his 50s he turned the tables on himself and began to question his own assumptions. What followed was a one-of-a-kind journey that took him to explore the nature of his own perception of the world which would take him into trying going caffeine-free and trying psychedelic drugs.
Now, he shares what he’s learnt from that journey with us. Michael’s book, This is Your Mind on Plants, is out in paperback this summer, and his Netflix series How to Change Your Mind drops July 12th.

      <title>Brewdog Founder: The Untold Story Of One Britain’s Fastest Growing Companies: James Watt</title>
      <description>James Watt is the CEO and founder of Brewdog, the Scottish craft beer sensation that is now valued at $2 billion. A former sea captain, he’s had to navigate increasingly choppy waters at Brewdog. But after a string of allegations rocked the company, ranging from personal impropriety to financial misconduct to marketing scams, James has had to start from scratch in Brewdog’s reputation, and on his own management style. 
For the first time, James walks us through his mistakes, what he denies, and what he defends. Where does the line blur between a hard-driving start-up and a toxic culture. It’s a tricky balance many challenger companies have to contend with. James’ is a story where he sailed a little close to the wind, when the revelations dropped it looked like everything he built could slip away. Can he navigate Brewdog back to dry land? He tells us exclusively how he plans to.

      <title>Moment 64 - What You Need To Know About Following Your Passion: Patricia Bright</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Patricia Bright lays out the benefits - and the potential pitfalls - of following your passion. We always have to stay authentically in touch with what we love to do, and why we love doing it. This moment lays out how people can lose their way in following their passion, and how to avoid it. It’s a rare gem who can persevere with their passion to the point where it’s not only their work, but work they love to do and feel themselves doing. We’re so glad she did, and we think you’ll be glad she did too.

      <title>Tony Bellew: Nothing Made Me Happy Until I Found This</title>
      <description>Tony Bellew is a professional boxer and a former British, Commonwealth and World Champion. As well as this, he is also an actor, and the star of Creed with Sylvester Stallone, and the author of last year's bestselling book, Everybody Has A Plan Until They Get Punched in the Face.
In this raw, honest and emotional interview, Tony breaks down exactly why people dedicate their life to fighting, and how it’s often because they have no other choice. But also because it comes to fill a need inside of them, and Tony opens up on what this inner need can do to you if you leave it unchecked. Many times, Tony has had to bring his life back from the brink - of poverty, bullying, defeats, and his own emotional instincts. 
His story is a fascinating example of how it’s often things we’re good at that cause us the most trouble, but when we face that honestly we can come through stronger the other side.

      <title>Bear Grylls: Man VS Failure, Anxiety &amp; Imposter Syndrome</title>
      <description>Bear Grylls is a British adventurer and television host who has been an international sensation of survival shows for twenty years. The host of Man vs. Wild, You vs. Wild, Running Wild, The Island, and the author of Mud, Sweat and Tears and over twenty other books, he’s come in to talk to us about his new book - Never Give Up. 
Bear has always told himself a story about himself that he’s ‘resilient’, he’s pushed through the toughest challenges the world has to offer - from climbing Everest to surviving in the desert - because he’s told himself he’s the type of person who survives. But now, he reflects to us about the costs of that mentality, and where it leaves you when you come up short. 
Bear’s new book is a follow-up to his smash-hit bestseller Mud, Sweat and Tears. He’s spent five years writing it, written every single word himself, and shares some lessons from his life he’s never felt comfortable sharing before. It was a pleasure to read, and a pleasure to speak to him in my kitchen.

      <title>Moment 63 - How To Get Any Task Done: Oliver Burkeman</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Oliver Burkeman tells us about the power of positive, sustainable habits, or as he calls them - 'radical incrementalism'. It's possible that by making just a little change to our daily lives, a change we can really sustain and not just keep up for a few weeks, then the accumulative effects we see over a long period of time can be life-changing. By enabling just little changes in our actions the consequences compound into something truly extraordinary.

      <itunes:summary>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Oliver Burkeman tells us about the power of positive, sustainable habits, or as he calls them - 'radical incrementalism'. It's possible that by making just a little change to our daily lives, a change we can really sustain and not just keep up for a few weeks, then the accumulative effects we see over a long period of time can be life-changing. By enabling just little changes in our actions the consequences compound into something truly extraordinary.

      <title>How I Raised $700 Million: Charity: Water Founder</title>
      <description>Scott Harrison is the founder and CEO of Charity: Water, one of the most innovative non-profit organisations in the world. Bringing the Netflix model to the charity sector, Scott has built a positive community around trying to bring drinking water to the 700 million people who don’t have access to it. 
For this episode, we’ve partnered with Charity: Water to ensure that all of the proceeds we receive from it will go towards providing drinking water to the people who need it the most. The story of how Scott came to lead a global movement in water provision is unlike any other. A former nightclub promoter and owner, he was a user of every type of drug under the sun before he cleaned up his act and started again. Because when he asked himself what was most important, it wasn’t his own pleasure, but helping other people. 
To help Scott in his mission, we are donating 100% of the advertising revenue from this episode to help people access clean water. If you’d like to donate also, click here: charitywater.org/thediaryofaceo

      <title>Moment 62 - Mens Mental Health Isn't Talked About Enough, Here’s Why: Roman Kemp</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. With it being Men’s Mental Health Awareness Month, I felt it was important in this week’s moment to focus on the importance of checking in with this prevalent topic in our current society. Roman Kemp tells us about the time he nearly lost his life, and how he was saved by a simple phone call from his mother checking up on him. Suffering from depression since he was a teenager, Roman has sometimes had trouble finding balance in his life. Thankfully, no one knew the ins and outs of his struggle like his mother. When she phoned him up asking how he was doing, he gave her an answer she was not expecting. She would never have imagined having to receive something like this from her son. Simple check ups with our friends and loved ones can have much more impact than we ever anticipate. Likewise, being open about our feelings can help to change them if they’ve gone down a bad path. I hope this moment from our conversation will help you to open up with your friends, and make this something normal to talk about.

      <title>Dermalogica Founder: Building A Billion Dollar Business While Looking After Your Mental Health </title>
      <description>Jane Wurwand is the co-founder of Dermalogica, which revolutionised skincare for millions of people worldwide. One of the first skincare brands when it launched in the 1980s, Jane got people to care about something they didn’t realise was important. 
Today she finally tells her incredible story in this conversation and in her new book, Skin in the Game. Jane’s story to self-independence begins when she was in a toxic relationship with a controlling boyfriend, in a strange country she knew little about. She describes feeling the physical hand of her late father on her shoulder guiding her where to go next. She picked herself up, and with a new partner used her new business as a fresh chapter in her life. Then, her industry was just one clinic in Los Angeles. Now, it’s a chain worth billions. Jane lit the touchpaper on a revolution, and in finding her own confidence, Jane helped millions of others find theirs too.

      <title>Moment 61 - How To Handle ANY Rejection: Dr. Julie Smith</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment episode, Dr. Julie Smith offers a different way of trying to get to know your own instincts to stop bad habits in their tracks. Through the techniques she offers in this conversation, people can get through a breakup or a rough patch at work without it knocking them back. As she’ll explain, the trick is always to look for patterns in your own behaviour, and the story you tell yourself about your own behaviour, and your own past. Because it’s only when setbacks affect the narrative you tell you about yourself that they can become a trauma. Control the narrative, and your ability to direct the course of your own life comes easily.

      <title>The Marketing Genius Behind Nike: Greg Hoffman</title>
      <description>Greg Hoffman is the former Chief Marketing Officer at Nike, and the author of Emotion By Design, a book about how to find emotional ways to tell business stories and connect your ideas through creative storytelling. 
Joining Nike when he was just in his early 20s, to becoming one of the most senior people of colour in corporate America, his life story is like no other. Here he tells us not just how to find new ways to get your story across, but delves into his own story as he tells us how he met his real family for the first time only a couple of years ago, and how that felt for him. 
Greg is an entirely new voice on how to be a caring leader and deal with the stresses of high-level executive roles. Because when it’s your job to find ways to connect ideas with other people, you first have to connect those ideas to yourself.

      <title>How I Taught Millions Of Women The Most Important Skill: Girls Who Code Founder: Reshma Saujani</title>
      <description>Reshma is the founder of Girls Who Code, one of the most influential non-profits in the world which has introduced millions of women to coding and the tech industry. She is also the author of Pay Up, a book about how to get women further in the workplace. 
Reshma was initially a prophet of the thinking that women could have it all, if only they tried twice as hard as everyone else they could achieve anything they wanted to. Now, she’s changed her mind. Trying to run an organisation with over 500 employees while looking after a young family full-time simply proved too much. Women simply have too much stacked against them having to juggle work and family life to properly pursue their careers without special consideration. What really stands out about Reshma is the fact that having built an enterprise that was on its way to changing the world, she had the humility to change her mind about major parts of her philosophy.
Reshma’s story is one of how to realise and bounce back from your mistakes, no matter who you are or how far you’ve come. It takes a lot of courage to do that, but courage is something that Reshma has never had in short supply.

      <title>Moment 60 - Jay Shetty: You’re Breathing Wrong, Here’s Why</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This is a favourite moment of mine because its so obviously clear that we should all be taking time for ourselves when we never do. This is a moment from my episode with Jay Shetty, the best-selling author of Think Like a Monk, host of the No. 1 podcast On Purpose and one of the most wise people I have ever met. Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too - this being one of them. Meditation. A difficult one to get on board with. We always hear that we must meditate more, but we never really practice it. Why? Because it's too woo-woo, or time wasting. Well here, Jay explains how much meditation can add value to our lives. All we have to do is put a time in our schedule that is time for us. Even if it’s 5 minutes a day, when we get that notification, we have to do something with it. The second step of meditation and taking time for ourselves is focusing on our breath. It's wildly underestimated yet it's one of the most important aspects of the human body. Our breath is connected to every single emotion, physicality and mentality.Meditation and breath are the practical tools we all need in our daily lives.

      <title>Strava Founder: How I Motivated 100 Million People To Stay Active: Michael Horvath </title>
      <description>Michael Horvath is the co-founder of Strava, the app to track and improve peoples fitness that’s used by millions of people worldwide. It’s his second business success, after he built a thriving online business in the 1990s.
But it hasn’t all been plain sailing for Michael. Initially quitting his first business, he spent several years as a family man before boredom launched him into starting his second. What he didn’t appreciate is that his calling as a family man would come back for him in a way he could never have imagined. Michael took 5 years off from Strava to care for his wife until her tragic death, and then care for his children in the aftermath of that. 
When he returned to a struggling Strava as CEO in 2020, he had to build it again from the ground up. It was something he was ready equipped for, because it’s something he’s had to do many times before.

      <title>FBI’s Top Hostage Negotiator: The Art Of Negotiating To Get Whatever You Want: Chris Voss</title>
      <description>Chris Voss is the former lead negotiator for the FBI, and the author of Never Split the Difference, a book about how to negotiate and how to get what you want from other people which has sold millions of copies worldwide. He has handled practically every high stakes crisis management scenario imaginable. What is unique about Chris’ technique is he emphasises seeing negotiation and deal making as a partnership, not a battle of wills. You only get what you want if you make an effort to understand what the other people really wants, and help them to understand what you want to. Making deals isn’t possible without a base of human-to-human connection.
In this conversation Chris opens up about a number of different type of dynamics we have to negotiate in our daily lives, from romantic relationships to friendships. We also get the inside scoop on what it’s like to handle some of the toughest situations, from bank robberies to hostage crises, anyone can imagine. What he learnt is that managing relations with other people is really about trying to help them, and all of us can do with a little of the help Chris brings us in this conversation.

        <![CDATA[<p>Chris Voss is the former lead negotiator for the FBI, and the author of Never Split the Difference, a book about how to negotiate and how to get what you want from other people which has sold millions of copies worldwide. He has handled practically every high stakes crisis management scenario imaginable. What is unique about Chris’ technique is he emphasises seeing negotiation and deal making as a partnership, not a battle of wills. You only get what you want if you make an effort to understand what the other people really wants, and help them to understand what you want to. Making deals isn’t possible without a base of human-to-human connection.</p><p>In this conversation Chris opens up about a number of different type of dynamics we have to negotiate in our daily lives, from romantic relationships to friendships. We also get the inside scoop on what it’s like to handle some of the toughest situations, from bank robberies to hostage crises, anyone can imagine. What he learnt is that managing relations with other people is really about trying to help them, and all of us can do with a little of the help Chris brings us in this conversation.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Chris:</p><p>Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefbinegotiator">https://www.instagram.com/thefbinegotiator</a> </p><p>Chris’ book: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/1847941494%20">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended/dp/1847941494 </a></p><p>Books mentioned: Start with NO...The Negotiating Tools that the Pros Don't Want You to Know - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Start-Negotiating-Tools-that-Pros/dp/0609608002%20">https://www.amazon.com/Start-Negotiating-Tools-that-Pros/dp/0609608002 </a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 59 - What To Tell People Who Are Stuck In Their Job: James Smith</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. James Smith is a bestselling author of Not A Life Coach and Not A Diet Book where he combines hard truths and empathy to his fans. He is also a personal trainer and fitness influencer with a unique philosophy that makes his message unlike any fitness advice you’ve ever heard before. Here he talks about the way ‘out’. Whether that is the way out of a job, a relationship or a situation we are always so hesitant to follow through with our gut instincts. We are all here to live and time isn’t something we can friverously throw away. He mentions the phrase “you’re a long time dead”, and it's something he tells himself regularly. I hope this moment will give you that push to do the thing you’ve been wanting to do. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/xtr8UWEKlqb James - https://www.instagram.com/jamessmithpt/?hl=en https://twitter.com/jamessmithPT_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Tom Bilyeu: From Broke &amp; Sleeping On The Floor To A $1 Billion Business</title>
      <description>Tom Bilyeu is the host of Impact Theory, one of the biggest podcasts in the world, and the co-founder of Quest Nutrition, the company that’s now valued at over $1 billion which revolutionised protein bars and supplements and was, for a time, the second highest-growing company in North America.
It took Tom a long time to find something he was good at that he enjoyed. Tom was sleeping on mattresses and friends' floors, now he’s a multi-millionaire. Why?

Laying out his controversial theory in more detail than he ever has before, Tom also goes into how to find personal fulfillment that satisfies YOUR needs, how to take personal responsibility.

      <title>Moment 58 - How To Improve your Life in 5 Seconds: Mel Robbins</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week, I’ve chosen a section from my conversation with Mel Robbins. Mel is the author of The Five Second Rule, a business woman, a life coach, and a sensation in the world of self improvement. At a point in her life Mel was really struggling with huge amounts of depression, anxiety, and fear, making it extremely difficult for her to get out of bed in the morning and generally just be present in her life. This moment describes the method that has changed Mel’s mindset to become who she is today. Mel got herself out of her dark side which saw her marinating in fear and anxiety, using her Five Second Rule. The rule was born from that window of hesitation that comes into our minds before we make a decision, a decision that could define your whole life. Inside that window lives fear, anxiety, procrastination and imposter syndrome, so we create patterns of feeling, patterns of behaviour, and patterns of thinking that tempt us to steer away from making that decision. It can be a dangerous cycle getting stuck in these broken patterns of denial so Mel brings this down to one fundamental method. The Five Second rule works because of its simplicity. You make yourself a promise, you count backwards - 5,4,3,2,1 then you do it.

      <title>The Man Who Coached Michael Jordan AND Kobe Bryant To WIN!: Tim Grover</title>
      <description>Tim Grover is the performance expert who helped to raise the game of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant to the legendary levels everyone knows them for. Taking over Michael Jordan’s personal performance team when he was in his early twenties, he’s been working with the world’s top athletes for over three decades.
No one knows more about winning than Tim. No one knows more about fitness than Tim. No one knows more about mentality than Tim. But Tim also knows about our hidden insecurities, the ones that drive us and we need to use to our advantage. 
Tim’s new book, Winning, opens the lid on what it was like to work with two of the greatest basketball players of all time. It is every bit as awe-inspiring as you would expect because none of Michael, Kobe, or Tim was interested in being anything except No. 1.

      <title>Moment 57 - Why You Need To Forget About The End Result: Sir David Brailsford</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. David Brailsford is the Team Principal of INEOS and is the main behind the ‘marginal gains’ philosophy, which can be applied in life and business more broadly, that paying attention to the tiniest details, no matter how small, can add up and together produce a big difference. He has numerous gold medals and multiple Tour De Frances under his belt to show for his philosophy. Here David puts us inside the minds of real champions and reveals the best ways to prepare for events and really place ourselves in the moment. Forgetting about the end result and rooting ourselves in the here and now are key. It might sound hard, but David has made it his business to train people for the biggest stages for twenty years. Want to know how it’s done? Let David explain… Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/Ajq3f7OsYpb Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Matthew Hussey: The Secret To Building A Perfect Relationship</title>
      <description>Matthew Hussey is one of the world’s most renowned experts on relationships and human connection. He’s not only helped thousands of people be more ready to meet the love of their life, but also how to have a meaningful relationship with them when you do.
In this conversation Matthew doesn’t just offer advice, but opens up about how he’s approached relationships in his own life. He freely admits mistakes he’s made, where his approach went wrong, and what he’s learnt. This is some of the most mature and reflective relationship advice I think I’ve ever heard. Because Matthew doesn’t just specialise in how to prepare for the good moments, but how to deal with the bad ones as well.

      <title>Classpass Founder: Quitting My 9-5 Led To A $1 Billion Business: Payal Kadakia</title>
      <description>Payal is the founder of Classpass, the app that’s helped millions of users find their passion. Her own love of dancing encouraged her to start a business which enabled anyone, anywhere to find something they loved to do.

How far Payal has come. Today she shares exactly how she got there. The sheer determination with which she ruthlessly sets her goals and priorities, and then systematically chases after them with everything she’s got, was hugely inspiring to me, and I’m sure it will be to you too.

      <title>Moment 56 - The Only Way To Build Confidence: Jacqueline Gold</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Jaqueline Gold has been the CEO of AnnSummers for over thirty years, and has had to overcome a lot of demons and obstacles in her life. But the attitude she’s employed to tackle these is nothing short of incredible. In this moment, Jacqueline discusses how shy she first was and she overcame that. She reiterated here that we aren’t born shy. It’s often our situational environments that create and shape who we are later on. No matter how shy or inverted we are, everyone has a fire inside them, an ambition and a burning desire to do what they believe is right. Jacqueline is a great believer that courage comes first, it forces you out of your comfort zone, and when you do this, confidence will come and great things will happen.

      <title>Jessie J: I Quit Music, Deleted An Album, Then Changed My Mind</title>
      <description>Jessie J is a singer and songwriter who has been singing professionally since she was 11 years old. In 2010 she shot to fame with the release of her first single, Do It Like A Dude. She has since sold millions of records, performed at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and been a judge on the talent shows The Voice and The Voice Kids.
This episode with Jessie is a special conversation. She was candid and open about the highs and lows throughout her life, and shared with me some things that she has never voiced before. From her early childhood memories, to the fame and success of her music, to health issues and grief, Jessie spoke with such honesty and tenderness. But she also talks about how she has enabled herself to break open and embrace the grief that she has stored up and hidden away. Jessie is someone who has always come out fighting, and here she goes into how that’s been possible in a way she never has before. We learn about how to stay grounded as you become famous, especially in the dizzying swirl of Los Angeles. I want to thank Jessie for her honesty and for taking the time to record this episode with me, it will certainly change how you think about a lot of things in life.

      <title>Moment 55 - This Method Will Boost Your Productivity: Ali Abdaal</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week I’m bringing back an episode from August last year with Ali Abdaal; a doctor, business entrepreneur, public speaker and all-round expert. It is important to resurface these ideas about productivity so that we can get the most out of our lives. This was an incredibly engaging conversation, as he tells me how he manages to squeeze every moment from his day. Ali mentions here that in order to do our tasks in the most efficient way, we should shift our mindset to think they are fun. This means that we become intrinsically motivated to complete them. One way in which we can do this is change ‘I have to…’ to ‘I get to…’. Shifting our mind to think that something is fun, will make us feel so much better about ourselves once the task is done. I also mentioned that when I have my own time to choose when I can be productive, I create time sensitive and task specific blocks in my mind. This helps to create a tick box mentality, and one which I can intertwine with what Ali says here. Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/5r583D34Apb Ali - https://twitter.com/AliAbdaal?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor https://www.instagram.com/aliabdaal/?hl=en Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Terry Crews: How My Porn Addiction Nearly Ended My Marriage</title>
      <description>Terry Crews is a NFL player turned film and TV star, featuring in a wide range of hugely successful shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, White Chicks, Everybody Hates Chris and Idiocracy. 
Escaping his abusive father, and spending decades cultivating his bodybuilder physique and mentality, Terry then broke into the Hollywood scene. This episode is the Terry Crews we have never seen before. We talk about some extremely deep, raw material and explore his deeply personal story of his childhood which led him into an addiction to appearing outwardly tough. His journey to where he is now is inspiring and the way he speaks about it is so humbling. Certain areas of his life that became out of control such as violence, sex, relationships, racism, shame, made him learn how to seek control of himself and his environment. His latest book, Tough: My Journey to True Power, is a moving autobiography where Terry faces these insecurities and distressing memories.

      <title>Piers Morgan: Dealing With Repeat Failure, Death Threats &amp; Regrets</title>
      <description>Piers Morgan is a journalist and television host who hasn't stayed out of the headlines since being made the youngest newspaper editor in Britain when he took over the News of the World at the age of 28, almost 30 years ago. 
Over the years he has attracted controversy for his disputed tactics in breaking news stories and television interviews. He is also the author of several best-selling memoirs. His long affinity for journalism has seen him leaving and starting new roles across ITV, CNN and NBC. Some of the shows include Piers Morgan Life Stories, Good Morning Britain, Britain’s Got Talent, and his newest - Piers Morgan Uncensored, beginning April 24 on the new TalkTv.
In this conversation we touch subjects of mental resilience, cancel-culture, mental health and veganism. You may not like it, it may not be comfortable to listen to, but this interview was an important debate which made me think about many of the things we spoke about. Piers believes his voice of common sense, acts as a vital counter-narrative to have in society and encourages us to build resilience, stimulate debate and stop over labelling things.

      <title>Moment 54 - How You Should Make Every Big Decision: Rochelle Humes</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week, I have chosen a clip from my episode with Rochelle Humes, who spoke to me so openly about her life, chasing the highest goals like never before. Rochelle has been performing professionally and presenting television since she was in school, and is also the entrepreneur behind innovative hair and skincare brand My Little Coco. Rochelle found success by being true to herself, and following her instincts. We all know this can be hard to do, so here we talk about how to make those decisions easier. The 51% theory is something that I learnt off Barack Obama at a talk we both did in Brazil. It comes down to if we are always looking for 100% of the facts, data and certainty to get our decisions over the line, it leads to huge procrastination and time-wasting. Getting to that 51% is a much more efficient system, and it reassures us that it will be the right decision to make.

      <title>Lilly Singh: My Deepest Insecurities Led To My Greatest Achievements</title>
      <description>Lilly Singh is one of the biggest influencers on the planet who was the first woman of colour to have a syndicated talk show on network television, but after it was abruptly cancelled she’s had to start from scratch on what she wants to do and where she’s going. 
With over 14 million youtube subscribers and over 11 million instagram followers, the world has always had a keen interest in Lilly’s story. She’s an incredible person who builds from her strong foundation of values, and has had to think increasingly more about what exactly those values are.
This is also the first instalment of The Diary of a CEO: USA, as I caught up with Lilly in California. Over the coming weeks and months, you will get to see some incredible conversations with guests the likes of which we’ve never seen before. Bringing more value, more incredible stories, and more world-beating expertise. Get ready, because this is going to be an unbelievable journey.

      <title>Craig David Opens Up About His Painful Rise, Fall &amp; Redemption</title>
      <description>Craig David is a singer and DJ who has sold over 15 million records worldwide. With over 20 years in the music industry, he is one of the world’s best-known singers. But when he found his career falling away beneath him, Craig had to reinvent himself. Coming back with the incredibly popular TS5, Craig has risen to the top, fallen back and then rebuilt himself back to exactly where he left off.
Nothing reveals the truth about yourself more than having it all and (most of it) being taken away. Craig had to dig deep and express what was true to himself, but first he had to find out what that meant.

      <title>Moment 53 - Why Doing This Is More Important Than Ever Before: Johann Hari</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Johann Hari, is the man behind multiple bestselling books speculating on depression, anxiety, happiness, and loneliness. In this clip, we talk about the important role spending time reading plays in our lives. We are so absorbed in the information that we see across social media because of the short and fast forms they are presented to us in. Whether that’s twitter posts or Instagram captions, the medium of these messages make us impatient when it comes to reading a book. Johann calls it screen inferiority which diminishes our ability to retain information. He explains that instead of skimming (or scrolling) across loads of things, we need to take a bit of time to think about one thing. Slowing down, looking at one bit and spending time thinking about what you are actually reading is how we are going to increase our engagement.

      <title>The Single Biggest Killer Of Relationships: Lewis Howes</title>
      <description>Lewis is the host of The School of Greatness podcast and the author of The Mask of Masculinity. An icon of American self-development, Lewis’ podcast has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times, and helped hundreds of millions of people. 
But the first person Lewis had to help is himself. Someone who always ran towards things that made him feel safe, whether that be towards working out, towards the need to get girls to like him, or away from his trauma. But an outside injury, and a reckoning with his inside trauma, meant Lewis had to start from zero. What strikes me about Lewis is someone who’s come so far after his life was turned upside down. When his world was spinning around, Lewis saw the way forwards.

      <title>Karren Brady: How To Win At Entrepreneurship &amp; Love (at the same time)</title>
      <description>Karren Brady is a businesswoman, Vice Chairman of West Ham, a mainstay on BBC One’s The Apprentice for many years, and at the age of 23 became the youngest person to run a publicly traded company when she was put in charge of Birmingham City Football Club. Not only was she the youngest person running a football club, but she was also one of the first women to be leaders in the industry. It is hard to imagine not only being one of the youngest people at the club you’re running, but one of the only women too. 
What has underlined these advances is incredible energy, dedication and drive. For Karren, breaking glass ceilings and being a first to do things is reachable for everyone, it just means working twice as hard as everyone else.

      <title>Moment 52 - Why You Need To Be Kinder To Yourself: Fearne Cotton</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Fearne Cotton is an author, presenter and podcast host with a goal to help all of her listeners find their own happy place. In this clip, we talk about one section of her book that hones in on the idea of being more self-compassionate. It's something I’ve spoken about a lot, talking about this voice inside our heads that talks to us. What Fearne says here is that we need to choose what we listen to, and what we focus on. We need to focus on the stuff that we like about ourselves and the things that we really want to celebrate. It’s a matter of where we put our attention and focus, and that is a hard practical discipline that we need to work on. It’s so important that we learn to become more self-compassionate. I hope listening to Fearne’s episode will move you in the right direction.

      <title>Wretch 32: How To Build Unstoppable Self-Belief </title>
      <description>Wretch 32 is a British rapper and the co-founder of Green Machine, a company that specialises in CBD products. One of the leading rappers of his generation, he is noted for his especially personal lyrics that movingly convey his making a better life for himself, as well as his relationship with those around him, especially his mother. With every line and every bar he wrote, Wretch pulled his way out of his Tottenham estate and the circumstances he was born into. Growing up surrounded by gang conflict, Wretch has had to navigate right and wrong in a world that sometimes seemed upside down.
But what’s fascinating about Wretch is he didn’t move away or let success lead him into a new life. Instead, he stayed in Tottenham. Because he didn’t want success to change him, who his people were, and what was important to him.

      <itunes:summary>Wretch 32 is a British rapper and the co-founder of Green Machine, a company that specialises in CBD products. One of the leading rappers of his generation, he is noted for his especially personal lyrics that movingly convey his making a better life for himself, as well as his relationship with those around him, especially his mother. With every line and every bar he wrote, Wretch pulled his way out of his Tottenham estate and the circumstances he was born into. Growing up surrounded by gang conflict, Wretch has had to navigate right and wrong in a world that sometimes seemed upside down.
But what’s fascinating about Wretch is he didn’t move away or let success lead him into a new life. Instead, he stayed in Tottenham. Because he didn’t want success to change him, who his people were, and what was important to him.

      <title>Jonny Wilkinson: Winning The World Cup Led To My Darkest Days</title>
      <description>Jonny Wilkinson is one of the most famous rugby players of all time. With a career spanning two decades, he has won the rugby World Cup, the Premiership, the Heineken Cup, the Six Nations, and the Top 14. 
For all those years, people didn’t really know what drove Jonny. Because when he was playing rugby, Jonny never felt good enough. Even the highest achievements in the sport would hold back his insecurities for only a few minutes. The journey of how he was able to break this toxic cycle and appreciate himself and the world around him to the full is one of the most inspiring stories we’ve ever heard. Jonny’s own podcast, I Am, is available for download now.

      <title>Moment 51 - Jordan Peterson: How Struggle Makes Us Stronger</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this moment, Jordan Peterson tells us all about the importance of struggle. Presenting his controversial view, he says that we aren't born with our virtues, they're rather forged in adversity. Because it isn’t the destination, it's the journey that takes us there. What people don't know about Jordan is that he's from a small town, in an oil town where alcoholism is very prevalent. Out of this Jordan had to find himself, forge himself. The values he lives by today, the vow he took with his wife never to lie to her, the desire to conduct himself with integrity in all his actions, aren't abstract concepts, they're hard taught lessons.

      <title>Moment 50 - The Most Common Misconceptions About Sleep: Stephanie Romiszewski</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week, I want to bring back to you a section from this incredible conversation I had with Stephanie Romiszewski, an experienced sleep physiologist and expert in developing bespoke treatment plans for sleep problems. Here we discuss the common misconceptions many people have about sleep, including the much perceived importance of getting those 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night. Her main piece of advice denotes that perfection is the enemy of the good; dictating our bedtime is the worst thing we can do to ourselves, and instead we should focus on the quality over the quantity of sleep and never expect to get that solid 8 hours that we have all been told to get. Finding a reasonable sleep routine, and maintaining it will allow our bodies to regulate and rest, which will eventually train the brain to use our sleep window as a sleep opportunity. Such an overload of misconceptions can go wrong, and cause even more panic for people who have become crippled by their sleep patterns. We often forget how efficient our bodies are, so we need to stop worrying about sleep debt and instead focus on a good routine.Listen to the full episode here - https://g2ul0.app.link/OrX6sjtZEob Stephanie- https://twitter.com/sleepyclinic https://sleepyheadclinic.co.uk/stephanie-romiszewski-sleep-expert/ Watch the Episodes On Youtube - https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Diplo: College Dropout To World's Most Iconic DJ</title>
      <description>Diplo is a DJ and music producer, who as well as being one of the biggest solo DJs in the world, is one half of Major Lazer and Silk City. But when Diplo was growing up in the deep American south, the music world seemed a million miles away. 
A journey to expand his horizons and connect with new types of people and music would take him to Brazil, Japan, Jamaica and many, many more places. DJs like Diplo are in the business of creating unforgettable moments and experiences for their audience, but what is it like to live those moments nearly every day, every time in a new city, every time in a new way? 
His new album ‘Diplo’ is out now.

      <title>Jaackmaate: The Untold Story Of My Battle With Health Anxiety &amp; OCD</title>
      <description>Jaackmate is the host of the popular Happy Hour podcast and a youtuber with over one million subscribers. From humble beginnings in Norwich to one of the largest internet personalties working in Britain today, Jack has had a hell of a ride.
But more thought goes into Jack’s comedy and its targets than you might think. Because Jack doesn’t just mock anyone, but is always interrogating himself as to whether he’s mocking the right targets, and whether there’s a sufficient ‘why?’ to everything he does. His ride to the top hasn’t been easy either, and Jack has had to overcome challenges he never expected along the way. From anxiety to dealing with criticism, Jack gives us the truth about inventing, and then reinventing, yourself on the internet.

      <title>Moment 49 - How To Form Habits That Actually Stick: Professor Steve Peters</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this one, I’m taking a section from Steve Peters, a doctor, psychiatrist, professor and mental coach for the world's top athletes and business leaders. Here he shares his wisdom about how we can form healthy habits and ways in which to maintain them. He explains that habits can be formed both consciously, based on our belief system, and unconsciously, the ones we aren’t knowingly thinking about. When we look to battle those good habits from the bad, it is not straightforward, and they need to be subdivided. Steve is the author of “The Chimp Paradox”, which has sold millions of copies worldwide and put forward the groundbreaking ‘Chimp model’ for understanding how our brains work. The model focuses on the 3 parts of the brain and he talks briefly about one of them here. The ‘Chimp’ which is our desire to be irrational, emotional, impulsive and short-term. Basing habits on our beliefs and experiences is letting the Chimp make those decisions, and sometimes we need to connect the other parts of our brain; the ‘Human’ and the ‘Computer’ to manage and control the interaction they have with habits.

      <title>Israel Adesanya: Becoming World Champion Was The Lowest Day Of My Life</title>
      <description>Israel Adesanya is the reigning UFC Middleweight champion, and one of the meanest fighters in the world right now. But in this conversation Israel gives a glimpse on what really drives fighters on, because Mixed Martial Arts isn’t just a physical contest, it’s a mental one too. 
Moving from Nigeria to New Zealand when he was still a child and different from other children in his class, fighting was Israel’s path out of bullying, seclusion, and low self-confidence. But winning alone hasn’t brought Israel happiness, in this episode you’ll find out what it’s REALLY like to be UFC World Champion. He’s so much more than that kid with a dream now. An international phenomenon, Israel brings us the exclusive on his path to the top like he’s never told it before.

      <title>How To Finally Stop Procrastinating: Oliver Burkeman</title>
      <description>Oliver Burkeman is the author of Four Thousand Weeks, a book that offers the most interesting perspective on how to manage your time that I’ve ever heard. He was a columnist for the Guardian newspaper for twenty years. 
The key lesson of Oliver’s book is what prioritisation really means. Make a list of the twenty-five things you want to do in your life, and then forget items 6-25, try and carve out some time every single day to work on your passion. It seems simple, but if it was more people would do it. We fill our lives with busy work in order to distract ourselves from the reality that our time is running out. This shocking insight is the key to understanding Oliver’s unique approach to achieve focus, and you might just gain some perspective along the way.

      <title>Moment 48 - 3 Core Principles For A Better Life: Mark Manson</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Mark Manson has sold over 13 million books, and is the genius behind ‘The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck’ and ‘Everything is F*cked’. His advice here is so simple, yet so moving and easily applicable to our everyday lives. For Mark, becoming a better person requires these three principles. Dealing with responsibility, making choices and managing expectations are at the core of our personal development and all interlink. If there’s no personal responsibility for our choices, nothing else is ever going to work or improve. Accepting responsibility, will allow us to move away from the danger of disempowering ourselves to progress. In turn, if we can make those better choices, and take responsibility, our expectations will naturally align.

      <title>Phones 4u Founder: The Pain Of Becoming A Billionaire: John Caudwell</title>
      <description>John Caudwell is one of the richest people in the UK, for many years he has been the UK’s highest-paying taxpayer. Making his money on the back of the mobile phone revolution, he is worth £3 billion. And he has built his fortune from nothing.
Growing up in a sometimes unstable household, John ran his first business while working full time as an apprentice mechanic. His energy and drive sustained him throughout his money-making journey. But this single-minded determination came at a cost. He sacrified friends and a social life, and has called his experience founding Phones 4u “twenty years of grief”. Perhaps no one has been more open with me about what it took to build their empire, and what it ultimately took from them.

Making his money on the back of the mobile phone revolution, he is worth £3 billion. And he has built his fortune from nothing.</p><p>Growing up in a sometimes unstable household, John ran his first business while working full time as an apprentice mechanic. His energy and drive sustained him throughout his money-making journey. But this single-minded determination came at a cost. He sacrified friends and a social life, and has called his experience founding Phones 4u “twenty years of grief”. Perhaps no one has been more open with me about what it took to build their empire, and what it ultimately took from them. </p><p><br></p><p>Follow John: </p><p>Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/johncaudwell">https://www.instagram.com/johncaudwell</a></p><p>Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDCaudwell">https://twitter.com/JohnDCaudwell</a> </p><p>Caudwell Children: <a href="https://www.caudwellchildren.com">https://www.caudwellchildren.com</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 47 - The Power of Good Communication: Nick Jenkins</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Nick Jenkins is the founder and former CEO of Moonpig.com, a company which revolutionised gift cards and is now worth over one and a half billion pounds. In this moment, Nick shares his wisdom with us on the importance of having good communication skills from public speaking to stand-out graphics and polished writing. Your ability to articulate yourself, think coherently and coerce a logical argument is vital to all walks of life whether that is business related or not. People often think that to be a good communicator you have to nail those public speaking events, but what Nick notes is that actually we practice articulating ourselves everyday. Making eye contact, engaging in conversations and listening to people are all things we can do. The more we output, whether that be speaking, writing or drawing the better we naturally become at communicating with people. We compare this to sales because at the baseline, we are always selling ourselves to people we meet, persuading others that we are the best. Nick is an incredible guy who leans on the power of composing yourself well in front of others in order to succeed.

      <title>Matt Hancock: Opens Up About His Affair, Mistakes &amp; The Pandemic</title>
      <description>Matthew Hancock is the MP for West Suffolk, the former Secretary of State for Health, and was responsible for leading the country through the COVID-19 pandemic until his time as Health Secretary was brought controversially to an end in summer 2021.
For the first time, Matt speaks candidly on what it was like to lead a country through a once-in-a-century pandemic, and the circumstances surrounding his resignation.
When I started this podcast, I wanted to bring you conversations that allow us to see behind the scenes, to give the context and this conversation is no different. You do not have to agree with Matt but I think after this episode today we will have the answers we’ve all been waiting for. This is not your typical political interview. This is a conversation that definitely needed to happen.

      <title>Moment 46 - A Tribute To Jamal Edwards</title>
      <description>Jamal Edwards: A true legend, role model and friend. In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast I usually pick one of my favourite moments across all the episodes, but this week after the heartbreaking news of Jamal’s passing I wanted to collate the best bits of our conversation into a mini montage as a dedication to the prodigious person he was. I hope we can all live in the legacy he left behind. Jamal Edwards played a huge role in my life, he was someone that I admired and looked up to tremendously. He paved the way and proved to young black men like me that I could become successful and achieve big things. Jamal is the founder of SBTV, the first new media business on YouTube, which is hugely successful, and plays a role in launching the careers of many, many people in the music industry, including Ed Sheeran. He talks here about the dimensions of being an entrepreneur, and how the mistakes we make often create the biggest hurdles to overcome and learn from. His wisdom and maturity are inspiring to listen to and as we delve into the subject of achieving happiness, he says his own happiness comes from being able to give back, to improve other people’s lives and to give people the confidence and self-belief he wished he had. We recorded this clip over a year ago, and I wanted to share with you moments from it that capture his genuine empathy, charisma and diligence. Rest in peace brother. Episode 39 - https://g2ul0.app.link/voBhicG5Snb

      <title>Moment 45 - Why 80% Of Relationships Don't Work: Mo Gawdat</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode, we go back to a moment from one of my favourite episodes with Mo Gawdat. We discuss something that I like to bring up with a lot of my guests; how to maintain love and keep relationships healthy. The way Mo speaks about his previous partner is phenomenal and should be a lesson to us all mentioning that he still admires her spirituality, love and wisdom. Mo explains that reaching this level of maturity in meaningful relationships requires work, trust and a total understanding of each other. Finding love and keeping love are not the same thing. In this moment listen to become a better person in your relationships. Episode 101 - https://g2ul0.app.link/9MCCcFlLnmb  Mo: https://twitter.com/MGawdat? https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat/?... Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>Jay Shetty: The 3 Simple Things A Happy Life Needs</title>
      <description>Jay Shetty is the best-selling author of Think Like a Monk, host of the No. 1 podcast On Purpose, spiritual friend to celebrities from Ellen Degeneres to Oprah Winfrey, and a former monk. 
Jay is one of the most wise people I have ever met. Very few people can reach into depths of insight on such a wide array of topics like he does. I learnt so many things I didn't even realise I needed to know from this conversation, and I know you will too. I definitely was able to put things into perspective in this conversation. Jay has a way of linking very practical advice to really profound insights about life. 
This conversation went in so many unexpected directions and was definitely one of the discussions I've found most personally valuable. Jay, thank you for sharing your wisdom with us.

      <title>Rochelle Humes: Learning To Be At Peace With Uncertainty</title>
      <description>Rochelle Humes is a television presenter, entrepreneur behind innovative hair and skincare brand My Little Coco, and a former singer. Rochelle has been performing professionally and presenting television since she was in school, and in this episode she opens up on a lifetime chasing the highest goals like never before.
It hasn’t always been easy for Rochelle. Growing up in a single parent household, nothing was handed to her on a plate. When she tried to launch a hair and skincare business which had some products marketed at people of colour, stores didn’t want to stock it. But in all these parts of her life Rochelle has found success by staying true to herself. Hers is a story of real perseverance. The new collection from My Little Coco is available now in Boots.

      <title>Moment 43 - The Key To Overcoming Imposter Syndrome</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This particular moment was taken from an episode where I asked you guys to send in questions you wanted answering. This one really stood out to me as its a question I get so often, yet I think people are looking at imposter syndrome in completely the wrong way. Facing the feeling of being outside our comfort zone is a challenge to overcome, but with the right mindset we can turn those nerves around into something positive. When you feel butterflies in your stomach, my evidence and interpretation of this nervousness tells me I am ready to do the thing that is instinctively making you anxious. Despite associating imposter syndrome with fear, I strongly believe that it is a good feeling to have. Growth requires us to step outside of our comfort zone, to push ourselves and expand our abilities. Each time you do this, the next time will be just that little bit easier. What people call imposter syndrome is a sign you're exactly where you are supposed to be. Though short I felt this was a moment that couldn't be missed.

      <title>Calm App Founder: From $0 To $2 Billion By Making The World Meditate: Michael Acton Smith</title>
      <description>Michael Acton-Smith is best known as the co-founder of Calm, the $2 billion meditation, sleep and wellness app, but he is so much more than that. Because Calm is just one of four companies Michael has built. Michael has also built Moshi Monsters, the breakout success web-based children’s game, which after rapid growth suffered a loss in users and for a while Michael wasn’t sure whether the business could survive. 
Michael has experienced the highs, but also the challenges, of growing big businesses. These are just two of four companies Michael has built. Michael is a natural entrepreneur who’s been founding businesses his entire adult life. To talk to him and share in his wisdom was a privilege I’m immensely grateful for.

      <title>Moment 42 - These 3 Things Will Make You Successful In Life: Jamil Qureshi</title>
      <description>Jamil Quresh is a high performance expert and psychologist. he's worked with some of the biggest businesses, sports teams and individuals to help them reach the highest level of performance. In my mind Jamil's episode was probably one of the most valuable I've recorded. I struggle to think of a better encapsulation we’ve received of self progression and how to always have an attitude in life open to learning. This is the episode to listen to if you want to learn how to better take responsibility in your own life, but more importantly what that means for your wider attitude. Especially having an open mind and being willing to experiment and try new things. I learn from all of my guests, but I think what Jamil taught me is how to learn better. This is definitely an episode for you if you feel like you’ve recently been stuck or like life isn’t throwing up the opportunities you want. Because it isn’t just the opportunities you receive, but the ones you look for, and how ready you are for them when they arrive. Episode 61 - https://g2ul0.app.link/w3n4SIUN6mb Jamil: Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamil-qureshi-494661a/ Twitter: @Jamil_Qureshi Website: www.jamilqureshi.com Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/StevenBartlettYT?sub_confirmation=1

      <title>Moment 41 - The Reason You’re Feeling Stuck: Mel Robbins</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Mel Robbins is the author of The Five Second Rule, a business woman, a life coach, and a sensation in the world of self improvement. Mel also runs a seven figure business which provides courses in self-improvement and life coaching. One of the most sought after motivational speakers in the world, Mel managed to turn around her boring, grey life into one that takes her all over the world meeting all types of inspiring people. At a point in her life Mel was really struggling with depression, couldn’t get out of bed in the morning and generally just felt stuck in her life. Since then she’s been on a journey to understand why she felt like that and what actions needed to be taken to get her out of that place. Today Mel uses those experiences of being in a dark place and dives into the reasons we might feel stuck in certain circumstances. She brings it down to one fundamental reason and what you can do practically to get yourself out of a situation that isn’t serving you.

      <title>The “Winning Expert”: How To Become The Best You Can Be: Sir David Brailsford</title>
      <description>Sir David Brailsford is the former Performance Director of British Cycling and current Team Principal of the Ineos Grenadiers, a professional cycling team that, along with its direct predecessor Team Sky, have won seven Tour De France titles since 2012.
David is behind the business and life philosophy of ‘marginal gains’, a belief that paying attention to every little detail, and then trying to improve it by 1%, will have massive compound benefits when added together.
Before David arrived at British Cycling, Britain was a relative backwater in the cycling world. Within a few years, he oversaw a team that won 8 out of 10 track medals at the olympic games.
In this interview David opens up about the good times, and also the criticism he’s received, like never before.

      <title>Moment 40 - The Solution To All Of Your Problems</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. This week we’re jumping back to episode 47, a solo episode where I talk about a simple solution that can help us get out of our own heads and overcome a tough situation. If you ever feel trapped by your circumstances, this is the podcast for you. What’s crucial to understand is that you can’t control your environment, but you can control how you deal with it. It’s through hard and challenging experiences that I’ve been able to build my own resilience using these methods. I want this podcast to go out to someone out there who’s in a similar situation but doesn’t know what to do.

      <title>How To Fix Your Focus &amp; Stop Procrastinating: Johann Hari</title>
      <description>Johann Hari is a journalist and author of Lost Connections, a book which changed the way I think about depression and mental health. His new book, Stolen Focus, is about what people can do in order to improve their focus, and about what we can all do to stop our attention being robbed in a world of increasing distractions.
Johann travels thousands of miles all over the world in order to complete his research, he’s spoken to experts on every continent and he’s come in to us about what he’s learnt on his journey. What Johann offers is not just practical advice for us all to take to improve our focus, but also what we can all do to change the way we interact with tech companies in order to make sure it never gets robbed again.

      <title>Moment 39 - Jimmy Carr: The Truth About Hard Work</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Jimmy Carr needs no introduction and is one of the biggest names in British comedy. Jimmy has hardly been off our screens for the last two decades. But what people may not know is that Jimmy has another side to him. When he was in mid-20s, Jimmy was in a boring office job, without much joy or direction in his life.

      <title>Moment 38 - Happiness Is A Choice: The Controversial Truth: Mo Gawdat</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode we go back to a moment from one of my favourite episodes with Mo Gawdat. Mo has co-founded over 20 businesses, he’s the author of the ground-breaking ‘Solve for Happy’ and he was chief business officer of the pioneering wing of google, Google X, the ‘moonshot factory’ where they work on all the latest technologies like self-driving cars and robots. But most importantly, Mo has learnt perspective about life. When his son died, this sent him on an incredible journey to look within himself and find the ‘happiness equation’, a simple technique that can help us all reduce our unhappiness and appreciate life, and ourselves, more. Mo Gawdat’s episode simply blew me away. There were so many hard-hitting truths which he exposed about happiness, but this clip might just have the best of them all. Happiness is a choice. This is something not everyone is willing to accept. But as you’ll hear in this moment episode, you can only be happy once you choose to be. Episode 101 - https://g2ul0.app.link/9MCCcFlLnmb Mo: https://twitter.com/MGawdat? https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat/?...

      <title>Gymshark CEO: How I Built A $1.5 Billion Business At 19: Ben Francis</title>
      <description>Ben Francis has achieved incredible success it is easy to forget how young he still is. Founding Gymshark, a leading gym wear brand, when he was still in his teens, the company is now worth over $1.5 billion.
But it hasn’t always been easy for Ben. He is naturally shy and introverted, and public speaking is something that didn’t come naturally to him. Naturally resilient and sure of his mission, Ben had to learn how to transmit these feelings within himself to leading a top team. It took a lot of work and dedication, but through time and effort Ben was able to overcome his fears and inspire those around him.
Ben has gone from earning £5 an hour at Pizza Hut to pay his way through university to running one of the most exciting and fastest growing companies in the country. It was an absolute pleasure to sit down with him and hear his wisdom, and I know that you’ll think exactly the same way.

      <title>Moment 37 - There Is ALWAYS A Way: Holly Tucker</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Holly Tucker MBE has over twenty years experience building businesses. After working in advertising, media, and for a start-up, Holly gave it all up to start Not On The High Street, an online start-up with an inspiring mission: to give a wider platform for small businesses to compete with high street chains. I don’t think anything truly encapsulates the power of optimism in a better way as this moment episode with Holly. It doesn’t matter who you are, what you’ve gone through or where you decide to go, there is always a way to achieve what truly matters most to you. Episode 92 - https://g2ul0.app.link/VBEo4l8wcmb Holly: https://www.instagram.com/hollytucker/ https://holly.co/ Watch the episodes on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDiaryOfACEO/videos

      <title>The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A F*ck: Mark Manson</title>
      <description>Mark Manson is the phenomenon behind ‘The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck’ and ‘Everything is F*cked’. He has sold over 13 million books and his blog, Life Advice That Doesn’t Suck, receives millions of views every month. His new book is co-written with Will Smith and is called ‘Will’.
Mark is an interesting character with a fascinating story. Quitting his first proper job in finance within weeks, Mark ended up as a pick-up artist. He has since become critical of the pick-up artist industry, although said his job was more providing a kind of therapy for men rather than trying to attract girls. 
Mark’s message, although controversial to some, helps millions of people face their challenges and be the most confident version of themselves. Today, he brings that message to us. So you can judge for yourselves.

      <title>Molly Mae: How She Became Creative Director Of PLT At 22</title>
      <description>It feels like Molly-Mae has been a cultural figure for a long time, and yet she’s only 22. After coming off Love Island in 2019, Molly has only grown and become more relevant with time. One of the biggest influencers in the world, Molly is so much more than your typical reality tv star.
In a rare sit-down interview, Molly opens up to us what she’s trying to achieve with her profile, and where she’s going next. Coming into the spotlight at a very young age, Molly tells us what the experience of overnight fame was really like, what its challenges were, and what she wants to do with it. Molly is someone who is only at the beginning of her journey, and what really came across when she spoke to us was her still unsatiated ambition, and how she’s always looking to achieve more. Molly is definitely someone we’re going to be hearing a lot more from, after speaking to her I think I began to understand why.

      <title>Russell Howard: How To Laugh Through Fear, Anxiety &amp; Imposter Syndrome</title>
      <description>Russell Howard has barely been off our screens for 15 years now. The host of The Russell Howard Hour and Russell Howard’s Good News, his new special on Netflix is ‘Lubricant’ and he has a new documentary about trying to keep comedy alive during the pandemic, ‘Until the Wheels Come Off’.
In this episode, Russell opens up to us about what it took to get to where he has. When he was 18, he did a stand-up gig for the first time, and instantly knew it was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. Russell quit his job and his dad gave him one year to establish himself in comedy, he managed to get signed on to an agency… with three days to go until his year was up.
In a touching conversation encompassing everything from why he does comedy and what he sees as the value of it, to his closeness to his family, this is Russell as you’ve never seen him before.

      <title>Starling Bank: Building a $1.5 Billion Business Against The Odds: Anne Boden</title>
      <description>The story of how Anne built her business is a genuine blockbuster of entrepreneurship and perseverance. Starling is one of the biggest FinTech companies in the world, with billions in deposits, but after listening to this you’ll be amazed how it was possible. When her co-founder walked out of the company, and took the funding with him, Anne walked in to an office where she was the only employee on the books, and had to start the company she’d built all over again. Little by little, she came back, and a year later landed a mega investment deal in one of the most incredible stories we’ve ever had on this podcast. What really shines about Anne is the clear sense of mission she’s infused her company with. Anne really cares about doing right by the customer, and cleaning up an industry that historically doesn’t have a record of giving people a fair shake. Anne is in business to make the world a better place, and we think after listening to this you’ll agree that Anne’s story shows business success can come from the most unlikely places.

        <![CDATA[<p>The story of how Anne built her business is a genuine blockbuster of entrepreneurship and perseverance. Starling is one of the biggest FinTech companies in the world, with billions in deposits, but after listening to this you’ll be amazed how it was possible. When her co-founder walked out of the company, and took the funding with him, Anne walked in to an office where she was the only employee on the books, and had to start the company she’d built all over again. Little by little, she came back, and a year later landed a mega investment deal in one of the most incredible stories we’ve ever had on this podcast. What really shines about Anne is the clear sense of mission she’s infused her company with. Anne really cares about doing right by the customer, and cleaning up an industry that historically doesn’t have a record of giving people a fair shake. Anne is in business to make the world a better place, and we think after listening to this you’ll agree that Anne’s story shows business success can come from the most unlikely places.</p><p><br></p><p>Follow Anne: </p><p>Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anneboden">https://www.instagram.com/anneboden</a></p><p>Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/anneboden">https://twitter.com/anneboden</a> </p><p>Anne's book: <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/hrt2QoX">https://amzn.eu/d/hrt2QoX</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Moment 32 - Ant Middleton on How To Build A Bulletproof Mindset</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. If you need advice on how to build a solid mindset, then Ant Middleton is certainly the man for the job. He’s been in some of the most dangerous, high-stress and uncomfortable situations on the planet which is why I felt compelled to ask him how he built a mindset strong enough to deal with extreme distress. Ant talks eloquently on how he believes the answer lies within discomfort, something we’re not often pushed towards in the modern world. But with life’s inevitable chaos constantly on the horizon, building a strong mindset isn’t just desirable, it’s necessary.

      <title>Jimmy Carr: The Easiest Way To Live A Happier Life</title>
      <description>Jimmy Carr needs no introduction and is one of the biggest names in British comedy. Jimmy has hardly been off our screens for the last two decades. He has countless shows to his name, even performing in front of the queen. But what people may not know is that Jimmy has another side to him. When he was in mid-20s, Jimmy was in a boring office job, without much joy or direction in his life. But he set himself on a journey of self-improvement. Out of nowhere, he decided to quit and start again, the rest, as they say, is history.
Today, Jimmy shares with us the actionable lessons in how he did it and how they are relevant to YOU. Jimmy is always looking for lessons to take out of his incredible story, and I think after listening to this, you’ll definitely see that behind Jimmy’s extraordinary story lies a very ordinary person committed to trying new things, working hard, and pursuing his passion.

      <title>Moment 31 - How To Instantly Improve Your Creativity: Bruce Daisley</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Creativity is often labelled a skill which only certain people are born with. A gift for only those lucky enough to have it. This statement is NOT correct. We are all creative and we can all train this skill. Bruce Daisley (Ex VP of Twitter) explains beautifully how we can almost instantaneously engage the creative parts of our brains and allow ideas to flow. Here’s how to instantly improve your creativity.

      <title>Patrice Evra: Learning How To Cry Saved My Life</title>
      <description>Patrice Evra is a one of a kind. He has suffered more hardships, and has overcome more challenges to get where he is, than probably any other guest I’ve ever had on the show. And yet, Patrice has managed to overcome them all to lead an incredible life. If Patrice can overcome his background and experiences, you can overcome yours.
In this episode, Patrice opens up as never before on his background and his experiences when he was young, and after listening to this you’ll want to join us in thanking him for his honesty. Patrice has come through experiences most of us can’t even imagine. 
Patrice also gives us the inside on what made Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United such a winning machine, what people have got wrong about it, and where people go wrong in trying to achieve their own successful mindsets. In this podcast, you’ll be schooled on how to reach the top, and how to stay there.

      <title>Life Changing Lessons From 100 Of The World’s Greatest Minds</title>
      <description>Of all the guests I’ve had on, these have been the moments that have impacted me most. I don’t often talk about the moments that I’ve found most personally moving, but I thought I’d share them with you today. I’ve selected six moments, from all the guests we’ve had on, that offer the most life-changing advice.
If you’re new to this podcast, this is definitely the place to start. I found these moments the most meaningful, the most enlightening, and the most inspiring. From Elizabeth Day talking about the importance of failure, to Jamil Querishi talking about how you can find consistency, to Matthew Syed on building self-confidence and self-esteem.
No matter who you are or where you are in your life, you’re sure to take something from this. We’ve all been on an incredible journey with this podcast, where we hear the stories, the challenges, the highs and lows, of the world's most successful people. These are the moments that have been truest to that vision. These aren’t necessarily the biggest names, but these snippets have meant most to me. I’m sure after listening to this, they’ll mean something special to you too.

      <title>6 BEST Pieces Of Business Advice That Made Me Millions</title>
      <description>This episode, we’re doing something a bit different and I answer the questions that are most pressing to you. Over the past few weeks, more and more people have been reaching out to me for my advice and my opinion on the issues that matter most to them. 
We’re covering everything from how to best focus your time, imposter syndrome, what character traits it takes to build a successful business, how to reach out to successful people for advice, and what motivates me to get out of bed in the morning. Thinking about things so directly helped put them in a bit more perspective for me, and I hope they can for you as well.
In this community, we’re all about helping everyone, no matter who they are, to be the best version of themselves. We’ve had some incredible stories in the last few weeks, and we’ve got more to come. But I thought it would be important to pause, reflect, and take a step back. In the process I’ve found more clarity about some things important to me, and I think after listening to this you will too.

      <title>David Gandy: Highest Paid Male Model Opens Up About Insecurities &amp; Imposter Syndrome</title>
      <description>David Gandy is an icon and an inspiration. Once the highest paid model in the UK, the first man to ever hold that title, David changed male modelling for good. An icon of rounded masculinity as well as rugged good looks, David has been shining a torch for men for over two decades now.
Today, David tells us what it took to reach the top. Starting out as a pizza delivery boy in Essex, David has always had the attitude of wanting to be the best. Some things never change. Whether that’s staying till midnight in order to get that last delivery and be the number one delivery boy, or training in the gym five times a week in order to get to the top of modelling.
Now, David has his own label, which he’s launching in November. Creating a unique combination of lifestyle and fashion, David is taking a bold step in launching a business that’s uniquely his own. But he’s just doing what he’s always done, inspiring men to be the best version of themselves.

      <title>The Happiness Expert That Made 51 Million People Happier: Mo Gawdat</title>
      <description>It’s hard to know where to begin describing such an incredible person as Mo Gawdat. He’s co-founded over 20 businesses, he’s the author of the ground-breaking ‘Solve for Happy’ and he was chief business officer of the pioneering wing of google, Google X, the ‘moonshot factory’ where they work on all the latest technologies like self-driving cars and robots.
But most importantly, Mo has learnt perspective about life. When his son died, this sent him on an incredible journey to look within himself and find the ‘happiness equation’, a simple technique that can help us all reduce our unhappiness and appreciate life, and ourselves, more.
Mo’s new book is all about Artificial Intelligence. Mo has always been focused on the future and what’s coming next. And for the first time, working on A.I., he was scared. But what Mo found, and what he shares with us, is that the next technological age that’s coming can be a Utopia, if we choose to make it.

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to know where to begin describing such an incredible person as Mo Gawdat. He’s co-founded over 20 businesses, he’s the author of the ground-breaking ‘Solve for Happy’ and he was chief business officer of the pioneering wing of google, Google X, the ‘moonshot factory’ where they work on all the latest technologies like self-driving cars and robots.</p><p>But most importantly, Mo has learnt perspective about life. When his son died, this sent him on an incredible journey to look within himself and find the ‘happiness equation’, a simple technique that can help us all reduce our unhappiness and appreciate life, and ourselves, more.</p><p>Mo’s new book is all about Artificial Intelligence. Mo has always been focused on the future and what’s coming next. And for the first time, working on A.I., he was scared. But what Mo found, and what he shares with us, is that the next technological age that’s coming can be a Utopia, if we choose to make it. </p><p><br></p><p>Follow Mo:</p><p>Twitter - <a href="https://twitter.com/MGawdat">https://twitter.com/MGawdat</a></p><p>Instagram - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat">https://www.instagram.com/mo_gawdat</a> </p><p>Mo’s new book - <a href="https://amzn.eu/d/cvGj7ar">https://amzn.eu/d/cvGj7ar</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Follow me:</strong></p><p><a href="https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo">https://beacons.ai/diaryofaceo</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.

      <title>Ann Summers CEO: The Heartbreaking Story Of One Of Britain’s Richest Women: Jacqueline Gold CBE</title>
      <description>Jacqueline Gold has been the CEO of AnnSummers for over thirty years, and we think after listening to this you’ll understand why she’s an inspiration to people everywhere. Taking over AnnSummers in 1987, she is now one of the richest people in the UK, and is worth over £400 million.
At the beginning of her CEO journey, no one saw what she saw, that women might be interested in sex. Taking over a company run by and for men, AnnSummers and the sex industry was transformed by empowering a new audience, women. Female empowerment remains at the heart of everything she does.
Jacqueline has had to overcome a lot of demons and obstacles in her life, but the attitude she’s employed to tackle these is nothing short of incredible. Jacqueline is an example of the power of approaching life with optimism and generosity, no matter what it throws at you.

      <title>How I Built 5 Multi-Million Dollar Companies: Marcia Kilgore</title>
      <description>Marcia Kilgore is responsible for revolutionising the beauty industry through the multiple multi-million dollar businesses she’s founded and built. She’s the woman behind Beauty Pie, Fit Flops, Bliss spas, Soap and Glory and Soaper Duper. Marcia moved to New York with just $300, which she spent on a gym membership, became a personal trainer and started a one room studio where she provided facials and spa treatments. Within a few years she’d built a spa empire and sold it to LVMH for millions and millions of dollars. 
What’s incredible about Marcia is she never stops moving and innovating, and she hasn’t just got lucky once with one successful business, but has managed to do it again and again. Now, Marcia runs a beauty empire. Today she tells us what it took to get to that point, what she’s learnt along the way, and what she had to give up.

      <title>Moment 24 - Mary Portas on Finding Your Truth When You’re Feeling Lost</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. It’s becoming more and more apparent that in the modern world, many people are losing touch with who they really are. The systems of society which we live in today are turning us away from our truths and toward becoming who we think we’re supposed to be. Like many others, Mary Portas was once one of those people. The high street queen had it all, and yet she admits something was missing. In this moment clip, Mary reveals how she lost herself, and thankfully, how she found her truth.

He’s much older and much wiser now, and Klarna has had incredible growth to become one of the highest valued tech companies in Europe.

      <title>Moment 23 - Why You Should Embrace Failure: Elizabeth Day</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Failure is something which we will all inevitably meet throughout our lives, yet it’s something we all seem to have an incredibly toxic relationship with. Elizabeth Day is the author of ‘Failosophy’ and host of ‘How To Fail with Elizabeth Day’ so it’s no surprise that Elizabeth has a thing or two to say about failure. In this ‘moment’ from the podcast, Elizabeth and I read a couple of her 7 principles on failure from her book. Episode 77 - https://g2ul0.app.link/Iv9fxRGJzjb Elizabeth: https://twitter.com/elizabday https://www.instagram.com/elizabday/

Failure is something which we will all inevitably meet throughout our lives, yet it’s something we all seem to have an incredibly toxic relationship with. Elizabeth Day is the author of ‘Failosophy’ and host of ‘How To Fail with Elizabeth Day’ so it’s no surprise that Elizabeth has a thing or two to say about failure. In this ‘moment’ from the podcast, Elizabeth and I read a couple of her 7 principles on failure from her book.

      <title>Moonpig Founder: How I Built A $150 Million Business WITHOUT Sacrifice: Nick Jenkins</title>
      <description>Nick Jenkins is the founder and former CEO of Moonpig.com, a company which revolutionised gift cards and is now worth over one and a half billion pounds. Nick knows what it takes to build a business from nothing to change an industry, and today he’s sharing his wisdom with us on what he’s learnt along the way.
You’ll also know Nick from Dragons Den, on which he was a dragon for two years. Since leaving the den he’s become a leading investor in e-commerce and green energy, tutoring and giving a leg up to businesses which help to bring the future a little bit closer every day. 
Nick is an incredible guy and an astute and proven businessman, but more importantly he’s a grounded and inspirational individual. Nick doesn’t lead a flashy lifestyle or found businesses just to get rich, but instead sees his businesses as attractive solutions to real problems we all face. Before Moonpig, Nick used to tipex out greetings on cards and write his own because no one was offering a personalised service. He doesn’t have to do that anymore, he has a billion pound company to do it for him.

      <title>Moment 22 - How To Turn Your Ambition Into Action: Jamil Qureshi</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. It’s fair to say that most people possess ambition, yet almost all of those people fail to turn it into the required action to achieve. So it begs the question, why do we fail to act upon our ambitions? I put this question to the World Leading Psychologist and High Performance Coach Jamil Qureshi. Not only is his answer incredibly compelling, but it could be the key to unlocking your full potential. Episode 61 - https://g2ul0.app.link/3m9ExluWnjb Jamil: https://twitter.com/jamil_qureshi?lang=en https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamil-qureshi-494661a/?originalSubdomain=uk

      <title>Moment 21 - Professor Green on The Source Of Your Success</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Professor Green’s accomplishments as a white rapper, at the time he found success, is a staggering achievement. An achievement which, perhaps, wouldn’t be expected from a young guy dealing drugs to get by. So in this clip I ask Professor Green, aka Stephen Paul Manderson, to explain how he found success in his career, and then happiness.

      <title>How To Build A Following Of 10 Million +: Mrwhosetheboss</title>
      <description>Arun Maini is the UK’s number one technology influencer, with over 10 million followers across his social media, and over 1.2 billion views on his youtube channel Mrwhosetheboss. Today, he’s talking exclusively to us about his life, his passions and how he made it to the top.
Arun started small, using a camera given to him by someone and reviewing technology he could borrow from his friends. Today, he still records in his bedroom, but his job takes him all over the world, and a positive word from him is sought after by Apple, Samsung and technology companies the world over.
In his first extended sit-down interview, Arun talks to us about how he gives his all to every task he does, how he stays focused, and how his very competitive nature drove him to the top. But he also opens up about the pressures he faces. And he comes clean about how the very instincts that drive him on can make him his own worst enemy.

      <title>Moment 20 - Jim Chapman on How He Overcame His Failure Anxiety</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. It seems that in the modern world we live in ‘anxiety’ is a word we are all becoming far too familiar with. The same can be said for many celebrities and online personalities who at first glance may seem untouchable, however when you look a little deeper, no one has it all worked out. In this extremely open and honest clip, Jim reveals how a complicated childhood became the source of many of his issues. He also reveals how he has come to identify and overcome his anxiety for both himself and his new family on the way! Episode 78 - https://g2ul0.app.link/zubmaijq0ib Jim: https://www.youtube.com/user/j1mmyb0bba https://www.instagram.com/jimchapman/ https://twitter.com/jimchapman

      <title>How I Make $1.2 Million A Year From This Podcast</title>
      <description>This week we’re doing something a bit different, and telling you everything you need to know about the business of podcasting. Have you ever wanted to know what goes into an episode of The Diary of a CEO? The truth of the relationship with our sponsors, the equipment we use, and where I want this podcast to go. Well, now’s your chance.
This podcast has been an incredible journey, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built. When I started this podcast, it was just me in my bedroom speaking alone into a microphone. Now, we’re the number one business podcast in Europe for over 40 consecutive weeks.
Today, we step back to reflect on that journey. And yet, I’ve found that what inspired me to make the podcast then is the same what inspires me to make it now. I’ve always loved sharing incredible stories with you. I’ve always loved pulling out and sharing those little secrets in how people achieve - and maintain - success. And I still hope nobody’s listening, but if you are, then you keep this to yourself.

      <itunes:summary>This week we’re doing something a bit different, and telling you everything you need to know about the business of podcasting. Have you ever wanted to know what goes into an episode of The Diary of a CEO? The truth of the relationship with our sponsors, the equipment we use, and where I want this podcast to go. Well, now’s your chance.
This podcast has been an incredible journey, and I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built. When I started this podcast, it was just me in my bedroom speaking alone into a microphone. Now, we’re the number one business podcast in Europe for over 40 consecutive weeks.

      <title>NotOnTheHighStreet.com Founder: Rapid Success Lead To My Darkest Days: Holly Tucker</title>
      <description>Holly Tucker MBE has over twenty years experience building businesses, and today she shares that insight with us. After working in advertising, media, and for a start-up, Holly gave it all up to start Not On The High Street, an online start-up with an inspiring mission: to give a wider platform for small businesses to compete with high street chains.
Known as ‘Hurricane Holly’ for always doing everything quickly, she started Not On the High Street in 2006. Then, it was just one of three online marketplaces in the world, the other two being Amazon and Ebay. Now, her business is going from strength to strength, and employs over 200 people from her West London base. She has used her knowledge to counsel others looking to build their own businesses, and is the author of three books, the latest being Do What You Love, Love What You Do, about how to turn your passion into profit.
We think after listening to Holly’s story you’ll see how anyone can found a successful business, no matter what barriers stand in their way. Holly’s story is nothing short of inspiring, and we can’t wait for you to hear it.

      <title>Moment 17 - Russell Kane Reveals The Simple Path To Success</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Russell Kane was one of the most surprising guests I’ve ever had on this podcast. Not only is he intelligent and self-aware, but he is also very straight-talking, which is one of the reasons why I believe this ‘moment’ from the podcast is so powerful. Together, Russell and I were discussing success and what it truly takes to become a successful person. In actual fact, the path to success is a pretty simple one, but sometimes the most simple truths can be the most demanding. Episode 79 - https://g2ul0.app.link/5lybE6twDib Russell: https://twitter.com/russell_kane https://www.instagram.com/russell_kane/

Today, I’ve chosen one of the most powerful moments from my episode with Ant Middleton. Ant shares with us how liberating it can feel when you turn a negative into a positive and reveals just how easy it can be to shift your mindset to a more positive one. The truth is, failure and negativity aren’t always harmful to our success, in fact, Ant would argue that they’re both important in fueling our growth and becoming better as people.

      <title>Dr Alex George: My Hardest Day In A&amp;E, Family Suicide &amp; Finding TRUE Purpose</title>
      <description>Alex George is a pure inspiration. That's one of the best ways I can describe him. He’s selfless, self aware and just an all round great guy. 
He grew up in Nantgaredig, a village near Carmarthen, Wales. He is the oldest of three children. George studied Medicine at the University of Exeter and went on to work in Emergency Medicine at University Hospital Lewisham in London.
In 2018, George appeared in the fourth series of the ITV2 reality dating series Love Island. Following the show, he returned to working part-time at Lewisham whilst also making regular media appearances speaking about mental health on ITV morning shows including Good Morning Britain, Lorraine and Loose Women.
In 2019, George launched his podcast The Waiting Room with Dr Alex in which he interviews other healthcare professionals about topical health and wellbeing issues. In July 2020, George's youngest brother Llyr died by suicide. In January 2021, George launched a campaign requesting the UK Government prioritise mental health amongst children and adolescents. During Children's Mental Health Week in February 2021, George met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who appointed George to the newly created position of Youth Mental Health Ambassador. In addition, George also became a member of the Mental Health in Education Action Group.
This conversation has it all, its gripping, its open, it’s honest and it had me nearly in tears almost 3 or 4 times. I can’t express to you how selfless and down to earth this guy is but you’ll find that out from our conversation today.

      <title>Deliveroo Founder - From £0 to £5 Billion: Will Shu</title>
      <description>Deliveroo, wow this company is HUGE! I’m sure most of you would have used it but do you know anything about the guy behind it? My guest this week is Will Shu, founder and CEO of Deliveroo. Born in 1979, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, Shu grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. His mother, a scientist, and father, who worked in insurance.
He founded Deliveroo in 2013 with childhood friend and software engineer Greg Orlowski. Deliveroo operated in London for the first two years, growing via word of mouth. It now operates in 12 countries and more than 200 cities. Deliveroo is worth £5 billion, becoming Europes fastest growing company with 2,000+ employees. 
In mid-June 2016, Will and Greg received an award for the Best Startup Founders as part of The Europas Startup Conference and Awards, mainly given to technology companies. The company also received Fastest Rising Startup of the Year and the Europas Grand Prix award. In December 2017, a study by macroeconomic consultancy Capital Economics revealed that Deliveroo had helped create 7,200 jobs across the restaurant sector since it launched in 2013. It also boosted the industry's revenue by £460 million in the year to June 2017. The report also found that Deliveroo had helped add £372 million in value to the UK economy in the same 12-month period, a figure which Capital Economics projects to rise to £1.5 billion in the year to June 2019. By mid 2020, Deliveroo had not benefited from the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for food delivery from restaurants and takeaways surged. Deliveroo reported to be cutting 367 jobs (and furloughing 50 more) from its workforce of 2,500. Will talks about how hard this decision was at the time in today's podcast. 
Will is an incredible entrepreneur, one thats a far cry from the usual braggadocios CEO of a multi billion dollar company. He’s a humble person and lives a very modest lifestyle saying his life hasn’t change much at all since the early days of Deliveroo. This is conversation proved to me that you don’t have to be born an entrepreneur.

      <title>Moment 13 - I Have a Secret To Tell You</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Over the last few years I have gradually come to understand why, broadly, the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. This ‘secret’ which only the rich possess is something which I learned only when I became rich myself. In this ‘Moment’ episode of my podcast, I’m going to reveal this ‘secret’ to you all, as I explain why the pursuit of knowledge is the greatest decision you will ever make and how cleansing your social media ‘diet’ can vastly improve your chances of success.

      <title>The Rise, The Fall &amp; The Rebuild Of True Geordie</title>
      <description>My guest this week is my friend and all round good guy True Geordie, otherwise known as Brian Davis. Brian is from Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He was born on a council estate, raised mostly by his mother as he describes his father being in and out of prison and not really being the father figure he desperately needed. When Brian left home he went to work on the oil rigs, scuba diving to work on them underwater. He describes how this would put him into life or death situations on a daily basis. The colleges he gained on the oil rigs became his father figures.
After leaving the oil rigs he started YouTube under the name footballfan533, and first rose to prominence when his first video (titled A True Geordie's view on Nile Ranger) went viral. Brian quickly gained a following due to his expletive and passionate opinions, and therefore changed his channel name to True Geordie, uploading more regularly. He was originally known for uploading rants about his football, but has since become best-known for the eponymous True Geordie Podcast, hosted by himself and his best friend Laurence McKenna.
Geordie was chosen the host and commentator for the KSI V Joe Weller fight in February 2018. He had previously been a commentator for some of the charity football matches. 
I met Brian back in 2017 to record his podcast, we recorded it in a tiny abandoned bomb shelter that he paid £50 a day to rent out. Brian has come a long way since then, running a rapidly growing Youtube channel thats accumulating millions upon millions of views per week, he’s commentated on one of the largest Youtube events in history and he’s also created some of the best content I’ve ever seen. 
All of this was quickly ripped away from him last year after one of the hardest weeks of his life, something we talk a lot about today. He’s gone through it all, been to the darkest of places, anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation. However this didn’t stop him getting back on his feet and rebuilding himself from the ground up, coming back bigger and better than before.

      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. Krissy Cela wasn’t always the sassy, confident woman we all know her as today. In fact, like many other successful people, there was a period of time in which Krissy struggled. This is the story of how the ‘foreign girl with a moustache at school’ discovered her self-confidence and in turn, discovered her true self. Episode 57 - https://g2ul0.app.link/tEZovAdYvhb

      <title>Monzo CEO On Death Threats, Depression &amp; Digital Banking Wars - Tom Blomfield</title>
      <description>Tom Blomfield, wow what an entrepreneur. This guy has founded multiple multi-million-pound companies, that have become monumental disrupters in the industry. And let’s face it, Monzo, one of the companies Tom founded and led, is the one of the most forward-thinking, innovative, fastest-growing companies there is. Tom was born in Hong Kong and lived with his father and mother. His father was a business-minded civil engineer and his mother was an artist. When Tom was a child, he moved to London to attend grammar school in Amersham, Buckinghamshire then moving on to study Law at Oxford. Whilst studying at Oxford, at the age of 21, he co-founded Boso.com an “eBay for students”. After a few internships with law firms he decided being a lawyer wasn't for him and followed the entrepreneurial journey instead.
In January 2011 Blomfield co-founded the UK-based company GoCardless, an automated payment method that processes Direct Debit payments on behalf of other businesses and organisations. Blomfield stayed in Silicon Valley during his three years at the company, it raised around £35 million of investment and hired 100 people. When GoCardless appointed Hiroki Takeuchi as CEO in 2013, he left (keeping a "very small share" in the £50-100m valued company).
Tom moved to New York to work for dating site Grouper social club as their Head of Growth. Blomfield left Grouper in 2014, and it closed in 2016. Following his departure from Grouper Social Club Blomfield joined Anne Boden’s Starling bank as the CTO. Startling was, at that point one of the first digital banking companies. Tom left the company in early 2015 after reports of disagreements at Starling, telling the Financial Times that "he could not comment under the terms of his departure". Today we learn about what really happened at Starling.
In 2015, he founded challenger bank Monzo, operating with no branches and instead offering accounts online. In its first fundraising round, the company raised "£1 million in 96 seconds”. In April, Blomfield announced he would forgo his salary for one year to help his company during the COVID-19 pandemic. In May, he announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Monzo and taking on the role of president of the company. In January 2021 he announced he was leaving the company permanently.
This conversation today takes us through Tom’s wild entrepreneurial journey expressing the highs and lows of running a business. He also talks about the disagreements at Starling bank and ultimately his reason for starting Monzo in the first place. His stories are unique, and more importantly honest. Unbelievably honest. He tells you the mistakes he made, his deepest insecurities, his biggest challenges and the things he wish he knew. Wow this is a good one.

      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO.

In this ‘Moment’ I break down the reasons why I became stuck in my ‘summer bod’ loop and how we can shift our mindset in order to build consistent motivation.

      <title>Mary Portas - How To Stop Living A Life That Isn't True To You</title>
      <description>My guest this week is Mary Portas. You may know Mary from the high street, from business, or you may know her as the red bob, hard exterior business woman from the TV. 
In this conversation today I saw a very different one to the one I’ve seen in the media. Mary Portas is an English retail consultant and broadcaster, known for her retail and business-related television shows, founding her creative agency Portas and her appointment by David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, to lead a review into the future of Britain's high streets.
She’s worked in various retail roles: John Lewis and Harrods, Topshop. Then creative director at Harvey Nichols – which was her rise to fame. In 1997 launched an agency called Yellow Door producing campaigns for clients including Clarks, Louis Vuitton, Oasis Stores, Swarovski, Dunhill, Boden, Thomas Pink, Patek Philippe and Mercedes-Benz, Sainsbury's, Habitat, Westfield, Liberty and The Body Shop.
In 2013 she re-launched her agency as Portas Agency Ltd. Today, Portas Agency advises retail clients from every continent, and the businesses success is built on an obsessive understanding of human and cultural behaviour.
Today she’ll talk about an idea thats fairly radical to some people, especially people that are building or have built big businesses which is based on her new book ‘Rebuild: How to thrive in the new Kindness Economy’. This conversation is incredible, Mary is hilarious, she is smart and she is kind. On top of all that her brutal honesty blew me away which is a central part of what we spoke about, the idea of being true to yourself or facing the inevitable of ending up in disappear. Mary’s been a public figure, a media star, she’s faced public scrutiny but through it all she’s emerged as this levelled headed, down to earth, warm hearted individual. I laughed, I realised and I was deeply inspired and you will be too.

      <itunes:summary>My guest this week is Mary Portas. You may know Mary from the high street, from business, or you may know her as the red bob, hard exterior business woman from the TV. 
In this conversation today I saw a very different one to the one I’ve seen in the media. Mary Portas is an English retail consultant and broadcaster, known for her retail and business-related television shows, founding her creative agency Portas and her appointment by David Cameron, the British Prime Minister, to lead a review into the future of Britain's high streets.

      <title>Moment 10 - Jake Humphrey On The Building Blocks Of Success</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this clip, Jake Humphrey explains that understanding the ‘building blocks’ to success is what truly made him successful. He claims the ‘trick’ is to take absolute responsibility for everything in your life. Jake then tells us that now that he has his success, it feels somewhat underwhelming and anticlimactic as he reveals that he doesn’t yet ‘feel’ successful.

      <title>Liam Payne Opens Up About His Darkest Moments, Failed Relationships &amp; Entrepreneurship</title>
      <description>Liam Payne has been subjected to the intensity of the spotlight from the age of just 14, when he found global fame following his entry in to the X Factor’s seventh series, and the dizzying rise once he exited as one fifth of the group One Direction. The band was cemented as a phenomenon overnight-their success and the surrounding hype was likened to that of a modern-day Beatles at time of their debut single release. They became the first UK group ever to have their debut album reach number one in the United States.
There probably are not many who are better placed than Liam to discuss instantaneous fame and the churning of its 'machine’. Liam has gone from a teen star to a fully-fledged solo artist who has taken ownership of his career in terms of its creative direction and elevated further with a strong signature pop/rnb style and a string of hits both here and abroad. He’s had his music streamed over a total of 2bn times.
However, there is much more to him than the image of simply being a teen heartthrob or sugary popstar. The X Factor may be notorious for churning out ‘instant’ popstars but Liam clearly has a deep appreciation for music and the process behind its production. He studied as a musician prior to the start of his mainstream career and has grown as a gifted songwriter, with 40+ writing and co-writing credits to his name. He has previously said that he is accustomed to writing and recording entire albums in six weeks or less, and his evolution on personal and creative levels has no doubt been accelerated by his exposure.
This conversation today isn’t your normal “reunion chat” we speak about so much in a lot of depth, everything from his relationships, his darkest times and everything in-between. Its open, its honest and its inspiring. During our conversation Liam mentioned it was one of the best chats he’d had in a while and I felt that, I hope you do too.

      <title>Johann Hari - Everything You Think You Know About Meaning &amp; Happiness Is Wrong</title>
      <description>This podcast is a real treat and a podcast that you cannot miss! Johann has come back and what honour it was to record. He has to be my all-time favourite guest ever! His book ‘Lost Connections’ had such a positive, transformative impact on my life and truly changed my perspective on how I viewed depression &amp; addiction. I am sure that the information shared today will be valuable and important topics that our society needs to hear.
Johann is a very successful and inspirational British-Swiss writer and journalist with 2 books hitting The New York Times best sellers list. Born in Glasgow Scotland then relocated to London when he was young, Johann experienced some childhood trauma having suffered from being physically abused as child and his mother suffering from an illness.
Starting his career as a journalist he won many awards such as Journalist of the year and was named by the Daily Telegraph as one of the most influential people. Johann then went to onto being an author writing the worldwide known “Lost Connections” and “Chasing the Scream”. He also released a TED talk back in 2015 “Everything you think you know about addiction is wrong” which has now over 17 million views.
This honest conversation lasted around 2 hours and we even went on into the evening off air. I genuinely think that this might be the most important podcast you choose to ignore. I’m not giving much away, but you will thank me after.

      <title>Ben Fogle - Overcoming My Lifelong Battle With Self-doubt</title>
      <description>Ben Fogle, a TV presenter broadcaster and author who has reached the peak of Everest, trekked over Antarctica and rowed across the vast Atlantic ocean. A man that has faced adventure and put himself in the most high risk situations doesn’t usually pair with low confidence issues and fighting his own insecurity.
Born in Westminster everyone perceives him with a life of privilege, comfort and a quintessential posh lifestyle. Failing at school and only just getting through his university studies, Ben had determination for travel and exploring. He has lived on an island self-sufficiently for year, presented and made numerous well-known documentaries, written 9 Times Best selling books and is the United Nations Patron of the Wilderness. There is more to this man than I believed. 
The conversation we had was so diverse and we covered so much, going through Ben’s journey and getting down the core of the man everyone sees smiling in front of the lens. A chance for him to express in his words who he really is and the voyage of taking back control of his own narrative.
This podcast is going to open your eyes to reality and surprise you in ways you did not expect. The demand we have for materialistic things, to be happy all the time and push ourselves and take those leaps make us question what is happy and how can we be more fulfilled.

      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode I look back on a conversation I had back in 2017 with the Founder of Gymshark, Ben Francis. Together we look into how Ben’s resilience and composure under pressure has helped make Gymshark one of the biggest sportswear brands in the UK, and the insane story of when Ben wrote 1000s of handwritten letters to customers in order to uphold customer satisfaction.

      <title>Professor Green - How To Overcome Life’s Hardest Challenges &amp; Find A Purpose</title>
      <description>We all know Professor Green aka Stephen Manderson for his multiple chart topping songs throughout the years but there is so much behind each and every track inspired by his rocky upbringing, to say he has faced and overcome adversity to reach where he is would be a real understatement.
He was born and raised in Hackney, growing up on one of the most notoriously troubled council estates at the time. He has won a number of personal battles ranging from health trauma and poverty to parental abandonment. Stephen's mother gave birth to him at 16 years old and left him and the home when he was just one year old. His father was absent for the vast majority of the time, leaving Stephen troubled and alienated. He was raised by his nan Pat.
Stephen was stabbed in the neck in a near fatal attack with a broken glass bottle in a Shoreditch nightclub when he was 26. Convinced that he would die, he fled the club in shock and phoned both his mother and grandmother to say 'goodbye'.
In 2008, Stephen tragically lost his father to suicide by hanging. He opened up on this is in his pivotal documentary 'Suicide and Me' released in 2015 for BBC III. They had had a difficult relationship prior and only occasional contact - he had not seen him face to face for six years before to having to identify his body, and his last words to his father had followed a bitter argument.
In 2017, Stephen had a major health crisis and ended up with “a paralysed stomach”, totally unable to digest food. He managed to heal himself in large part through his own research and combinations of gut/balancing products. Since identifying a gap in the market for similar solutions through his own health battle, he has converted that newfound knowledge and research into co-founding liquid supplement company Aguulp, its product range receiving rave reviews so far.
Stephen is incredibly level-headed and self aware despite treading such a rocky path. His constant battle with mental health both personally and within the family has created a mindset that is very unique and this conversation is one that I think everyone needs to hear.

      <title>Moment 4 - How I Discovered A More Grateful Perspective</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes of my podcast, I’ll be selecting my favourite moments from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode I look back on a trip I took to India where I got to take a look at what life is like in the slums of Mumbai. This entire experience shifted my perspective completely and yet the most surprising thing about what I was seeing wasn’t the grim reality of poverty, but the unshakable fact that these people were happy. I walked away from those slums with an entirely new perspective on the privilege we have been given from birth, and this is where I introduce how I discovered a more grateful perspective Full episode - https://g2ul0.app.link/uPvHRJw80fb

      <title>Russell Kane: How To Build Confidence &amp; Stay Young</title>
      <description>My guest this week is Russell Kane, a Multi-award-winning comedian, presenter, actor, author and scriptwriter. Russell Kane is best known for the BBC Radio 4 podcast Evil Genius, which has become a flagship show and was the best performing original podcast on the BBC Sounds platform. Russell's other podcast, Boys Don't Cry, also features regularly on the iTunes podcast chart. 
Kane is also the author of two books, “The Humorist” and the very well-received memoir about his father “Son of a Silverback: Growing Up in the Shadow of an Alpha Male”. Russell went on to make history as the first comedian to win both the Edinburgh Award and Melbourne Comedy Festival's Barry Award in one year.
In this conversation you see the less funny side of Russell, it is however one of the most informative, fascinating and mind-boggling conversations I've ever had on this podcast. This guy has more knowledge than you could ever imagine and I think you’re really going to enjoy this chat.

      <title>Moment 1 - Johann Hari On Why We're Becoming Less Happy And More Lonely</title>
      <description>In these ‘Moment’ episodes I will be selecting my favourite sections from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode Journalist and Author Johann Hari, most well known for writing the New York Times bestselling book ‘Lost Connections’, explains why as humans we are becoming less happy and more lonely. As a species, we are becoming more and more disconnected, and Johann mainly puts this down to the fact that we are being driven by ‘junk’ values. Like junk food, our ‘junk’ values seem to be attractive to us, but really only go on to harm both us and our happiness. Johann explains that only once we begin to understand our intrinsic and extrinsic motivations will we finally be free to live a more connected and happier life.

        <![CDATA[<p>In these ‘Moment’ episodes I will be selecting my favourite sections from previous episodes of The Diary Of A CEO. In this episode Journalist and Author Johann Hari, most well known for writing the New York Times bestselling book ‘Lost Connections’, explains why as humans we are becoming less happy and more lonely. As a species, we are becoming more and more disconnected, and Johann mainly puts this down to the fact that we are being driven by ‘junk’ values. Like junk food, our ‘junk’ values seem to be attractive to us, but really only go on to harm both us and our happiness. Johann explains that only once we begin to understand our intrinsic and extrinsic motivations will we finally be free to live a more connected and happier life.

      <title>Rio Ferdinand Reveals The Training Ground &amp; Dressing Room Secrets That Made United Unbeatable.</title>
      <description>This week’s podcast guest, is not like any I’ve had on before... I am proud to introduce to you my friend, and football legend Rio Ferdinand. As a former Football player, he is one of the most decorated English footballers of all time and regarded by many loyal fans – one of England’s greatest players. I grew up as a United Fan, watching him, idolising him and now he is my mate. Growing up on an Estate in Peckham, Rio’s parents encouraged his curiosity. Many of you, may not know, Rio danced ballet to a high standard before choosing to pursue a career in football... and well, you might think you know how the story goes. You don’t.
In this open, intimate and honest conversation Rio talks about his achievements, failures, successes and how his life experiences have made him the father he is today. Rio has broken many football records during his premiership – He joined Manchester United in July 2002 for record breaking fee of £30 million. He has featured in the PFA Team of the Year four times in 5 years. More club magic spread, as the club followed with another Premier league Win in 2006-07 all under Sir Alex Fergusons lead. During Rio’s time at United, Rio respectfully won 6 Premier League Titles and 14 Trophies. Rio announced his retirements from professional football on 30 May 2015. After retirement Rio has joined BT Sport as a Pundit. The BBC one documentary - Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad. The documentary won the Robert Flaherty Award for Single Documentary at the 2018 BAFTA Awards.
Rio is a special guy, not least for what he’s achieved but for who he is. Today, you’re going to find out who he actually is. The philosophy to life that he swears by, and the culture required for you to win in an ambitious career - but also the culture required to win in your personal life.

      <title>Ant Middleton Opens Up About His Personal Demons, Being "Cancelled" &amp; His Spirituality</title>
      <description>Ant Middleton is an adventurer, military vet, television host and author who is has become a majorly respected authority when it comes to survival and endurance techniques due to his experience within the elite and special forces. He went on to become of only a handful of those able to complete the military’s gruelling “Holy Trinity”, serving with the Paras, the Royal Marines and Special Forces (in the Special Boat Service, sister force of the SAS). He has served on military tours of Northern Ireland, Macedonia (peacekeeping), Sierra Leone and Afghanistan (in 2007 and 2008). 
Ant has remained grounded in a philosophy of embracing personal power and individual responsibility at all times. Ant has a very straightforward view of manhood and describes his peers as 'military alpha males'. Ant readily admits that he has been 'exposed' to so much that it's almost impossible for him to feel an adrenaline rush at this stage in his life... 
Most recently Ant has been caught up in a media storm after Channel 4 axed him from SAS: Who Dares Wins after five years, the broadcaster said that ant’s 'views and values we not aligned to theirs'. 
This is his first in-depth conversation he recorded since he was “cancelled”. Ant, Thank you for your honesty. This weeks episode entitled 'Ant Middleton Opens Up About His Personal Demons, Being "Cancelled" &amp; His Spirituality'

      <title>World Leading Sex Therapist - How To Avoid Having Bad Sex - Kate Moyle</title>
      <description>In this week’s podcast I am sharing some of my own sexual experiences which I have never shared before - Things which have gone well and what has caused some relationships, I’ve cared deeply about to end. I am being open and honest. I feel vulnerable about sharing some of these experiences… so keep this to yourself.
My guest this week is Kate Moyle. Kate is a COSRT (College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists) Accredited Psychosexual and Relationship Therapist, Sex Expert for Sex Toy Brand Lelo, and host of The Sexual Wellness Sessions Podcast.
 Kate works empathetically with people to recognise their personal understanding of their sexuality and sexual health; with the view that issues have roots in psychology, emotion, the physical body, and a person’s history and culture. 
Kate specialises in working with those who are struggling with difficulties in their sex lives, relationships and sexuality. Many of her clients are like you and I impacted by the stresses of modern life. Kate and I will be having a very open and real conversations about sex, to help you feel more educated, aware of sexual wellness and feel comfortable in your sexuality.
We will be taking taboo conversations about sex and relationships (which we don’t normally chat about) out of the therapy room and into the mainstream, so you can hear what is really happening.

      <title>Jack Maynard: The Untold Story: How Being Thrown Out The Jungle Changed My Life Forever</title>
      <description>Jack Maynard is a British YouTuber who is best known for his parodies, vlogs and collaborations with other famous YouTubers including Joe Sugg, Oli White and Caspar Lee. Jack’s Youtube channel took off extremely quickly, amassing a following of 1.5m subscribers on his main channel since 2015. He is also the younger brother of Conor Maynard, a singer-songwriter and musician who shot to fame after being spotted on YouTube aged 15, and Anna Maynard who is a popular influencer, singer and YouTuber in her own right.
At 23, he was the first YouTuber to appear on ITV’s 'I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!' (2017). He found himself embroiled in a scandal when he was removed from the show after just three days over tweets he made in 2011. This left Jack facing public scrutiny, being part of a British cancel culture moment, events which would change him forever.
After various struggles as a result of ‘I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here’ Jack returned to TV screens with an appearance on Channel 4’s 'Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins' in 2020 to help him overcome what he’d been struggling with for the past three years.

      <itunes:summary>Jack Maynard is a British YouTuber who is best known for his parodies, vlogs and collaborations with other famous YouTubers including Joe Sugg, Oli White and Caspar Lee. Jack’s Youtube channel took off extremely quickly, amassing a following of 1.5m subscribers on his main channel since 2015. He is also the younger brother of Conor Maynard, a singer-songwriter and musician who shot to fame after being spotted on YouTube aged 15, and Anna Maynard who is a popular influencer, singer and YouTuber in her own right.
At 23, he was the first YouTuber to appear on ITV’s 'I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!' (2017). He found himself embroiled in a scandal when he was removed from the show after just three days over tweets he made in 2011. This left Jack facing public scrutiny, being part of a British cancel culture moment, events which would change him forever.
After various struggles as a result of ‘I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here’ Jack returned to TV screens with an appearance on Channel 4’s 'Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins' in 2020 to help him overcome what he’d been struggling with for the past three years.

      <title>Grace Beverley: How To Build A Multi-Million Pound Empire At 24</title>
      <description>Grace is an entrepreneur, brand founder, influencer and Oxford University graduate who defied expectations and took her post-grad journey in an unexpected direction by launching 2 major brands: [We Are] TALA (sustainable, slow fashion activewear label) and fitness app Shreddy. TALA’s performance since its launch in 2019 shows it to be one of the biggest positive disruptors in the gymwear space both in the UK and overseas. At the core of the brand is a focus on ethical, eco-efficient manufacture practices. The designs are inclusive in terms of size and shape range: Grace has spoken of the importance of personalising your fitness and health journey rather than subscribing to what's most popular or promoted on social media. Grace has remained outspoken on the challenges faced by women in business, even in 2021.
A social conscience runs through all three of her companies: up-cycled offcuts and recyclable materials are incorporated into products from TALA while remaining available to consumers at affordable prices. Grace also used to vlog her daily life with great success, sharing her ups and downs as a 20-something year-old. Longtime subscribers of hers have had the chance to join her on a more personal journey.
However, she stepped away from vlogging a year ago to pursue her business ventures. Grace launched both Shreddy and TALA within a month of her final university exams. She is frequently discussed by followers for her drive and ability to be able to take on multiple projects at once with tons of enthusiasm. Shreddy has received widespread press coverage since its launch, and Grace has recently pulled off a major partnership with celeb/influencer Jordyn Woods in LA, as well as collaborations with brands such as KOI footwear (an exclusive line of vegan footwear released in 2019).

      <title>Suicidal Drug Addict To Elite Military Commando with Ben Williams</title>
      <description>From an early age Ben was subjected to a violent parent relationship which saw his family break apart, with only his mother to defend both himself and his brother. Through severe bullying and family upheaval, he moved home six times and went to six different schools within ten years of his life. After an unfortunate incident as a nightclub bouncer involving the death of a patron, Ben fell into a world of drug abuse, gambling and addiction, balancing on the brink of life. Broke, with no home or anyone to turn to, he abused his addictions every day and battled suicidal thoughts. Ben saw an advert on YouTube for the Royal Marines and knew he had one chance left at life by joining. Joining the marines gave him a purpose, he trained religiously, day and night to get fit and read and revised military tactics to increase his knowledge. And he didn’t have a single hand in getting clean from the drugs – his mind, determination and sheer drive got him clean – he was thinking differently.
During his ten years with the Royal Marines – one of the most elite regiments in the world, Ben travelled the world, seeing active operational duties in Afghanistan. The Corps was a rollercoaster journey involving the extreme highs, and lows of war. After being injured in an IED blast in Afghanistan, he returned to the UK with the horrors of war still imprinted on his mind. He had to stay at home with his thoughts – now in a completely new battle.
He turned back into his old self before the marines, drinking, gambling and getting in trouble. The dark thoughts were intrusive. After one alcohol fuelled event, Ben was court-martialed and sent for trial; with his first son on the way he was staring at a four-year sentence for assault, but he fortunately escaped prison by a judge who took pity on him. Broken and at his wits end, a friend lent him ‘the chimp paradox’; and he found himself immersed in self help books and receiving treatment for PTSD.
Like a breath of fresh air, his life changed almost instantly. Ben finally found the answers from experts to understand his behaviour. When his demons were brought under control, he was given the opportunity to join the Commando training centre in Lympstone. As a recruit instructor, he entered the world of coaching and helping others; which saw him flourish.
As a result of his ability, he ended up working with the England football team, where the next part of the journey begins. After being medically discharged, he now owns a leadership and performance coaching company, Vanguard and Find Your Edge, that helps organisations achieve their goals by employing a new mindset; working with many elite professional sports stars, and elite businesses to achieve more.

      <title>How To Chase Your Dreams Without Fear Holding You Back with Fran Millar</title>
      <description>My guest this week is an inspiring woman and a brilliant leader, Fran Millar. Fran was recently appointed CEO of the UK fashion brand, Belstaff. Prior to Belstaff, Fran was the former CEO of Team INEOS (formerly Team Sky), the world famous cycling team. Fran led the development of the team’s operational and governance systems alongside all of the business and engagement strategies. Fran has been with team INEOS from the very beginning and during this time she has played a key role in the successes and gained considerable experience in all areas of the team. 
She previously held a dual role as both Director of Business Operations and Head of Winning Behaviours at Team Sky. Returning to head up all the team’s ‘off bike’ functions in 2015, her responsibilities included overseeing the team’s marketing and communications strategy, stakeholder management, and all the commercial and legal aspects that come with running the world’s number one cycling team. Fran worked alongside the incomparable Sir Dave Brailsford for over a decade, as well as leading sports psychiatrist, professor Steve Peters.
Prior to working at Team Sky, Fran set-up and ran her own successful athlete and event management agency for 7 years, initially representing her brother, David Millar and going on to represent some of the UK’s highest profile cyclists, including 2011 Sports Personality of the Year winner Mark Cavendish and 2018 Tour de France winner and 2018 Sports Personality of the Year winner, Geraint Thomas. During her career in cycling, Fran had to deal with some tough challenges including getting caught up in tan infamous doping scandal that involved her pro cyclist brother David.
Fran’s story is a fascinating one, one that has twists and turns, one that would have left a lot of people behind but not Fran. Fran is tough, she’s tenacious, she’s inspiring.

      <title>The Secret To Loving Your Work with Bruce Daisley</title>
      <description>Bruce Daisley is one of the world’s most influential voices on fixing workplace culture and a former VP at Twitter. Bruce Daisley spent over a decade as a top executive at Twitter, YouTube and Google for Europe, leaving Twitter as its most senior leader outside of the US.
Bruce’s highly acclaimed book, The Joy of Work: 30 Ways to Fix Your Work Culture and Fall in Love with Your Job Again, offers a fascinating and data-tested insight into what ‘work’ and ‘office culture’ now looks-like in the 21st century, as well as advising how all levels of staff within organisations can build a more motivating and productive workplace culture. The book went on to become the UK’s bestselling business hardback of 2019, being translated into 13 languages and long-listed for Business Book of the Year 2020 and CMI Management Book of the Year 2020. His literary and business successes have culminated in Bruce being named one of the Evening Standard’s 1000 Most Influential Londoners and one of Debrett’s 500 Most Influential People in Britain.
At the CBI Annual Conference, he was voted the top-rated speaker, having shared the stage with the Prime Minister and Jeremy Corbyn. Alongside his literary pursuits, Bruce hosts and runs the ‘Eat Sleep Work Repeat’ podcast on workplace culture which has reached #1 spot on the Apple Business Podcast Chart. He now devotes his time to championing reforms to culture in the workplace. 
He is also a published writer in the Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal &amp; The Guardian.

      <title>I Won 11 World Titles Because They Said I Couldn't - Anna Hemmings MBE</title>
      <description>My guest this week is kayaking legend Anna Hemmings MBE. Anna is Britain’s most successful female marathon kayaker with a staggering eleven World and European Championship medals, 9 of them gold. By the age of 24 she had been a World Champion 3 times and competed at the Olympic Games. In 2010 she was awarded an MBE for her services to sport. Hemmings achieved this success against all the odds. She was told by the British head coach that she was not big enough or strong enough to be a great kayaker. She proved him wrong.
At the peak of her career, Anna was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and was told by medical experts she might never race again. She battled her way to full recovery and went on to win a further 3 world titles and compete at her second Olympic Games in Beijing 2008. She has become an expert in the field of resilience and high performance. Anna is now an Executive coach and founded Beyond the Barriers, a high performance training consultancy which works globally with leaders and teams giving them practical tools and strategies to enable them to thrive under pressure, build resilience, be mentally tough in challenging environments and deliver world class performance.
Anna’s sporting achievements were recognised at the Sunday Times Sports Woman of the Year Awards, where she won the 2005 Champions Award and then again in 2007 when she was voted BBC London Sports Personality of the Year. This week's podcast gave me more realisations than I’ve ever had from a guest before. We spoke about the multiple challenges she faced throughout her career and how despite all of the hardships, she was able to keep going when all the signs were there to give-up. We also delved into her expertise in resilience and high performance, discussing the steps she takes to help people become the greatest version of themselves.

      <description>It’s coming to that time of year when everyone starts to reminisce about the year that has just been and thinks about the changes they can make to have a better, happier future... 
The thing is though, this year has been different to any other that has gone before! It’s been difficult, it’s been a struggle, it’s been heartbreaking! Within the hard times of life we tend to learn more about ourselves and who we are. For that reason, I’ve decided to host a two part end of year special podcast episode to take a look back at the biggest lessons I’ve learnt during one of the hardest year of our lives and how we can try and make 2021 a better year.

      <title>Eddie Hearn on Selling Matchroom For 5 Billion</title>
      <description>In this week’s episode I sat down with the man who is putting British boxing on the map, Eddie Hearn. You’ll probably know him as a confident, boisterous, loud promoter. But when you dig a little deeper, I found something else, something much more revealing, something that made me unsure whether I should feel sorry for him, or be impressed by him.
During our discussion he shared so many pieces of valuable information from his journey climbing to the very top of the business ladder… and he isn’t finished yet!

      <title>How She Built Her Confidence, and Then an Empire with Krissy Cela</title>
      <description>Parts of this episode made me feel uncomfortable, it may make you feel the same, but trust me, you need to hear this. This week I sat down with Krissy Cela, this was such a brave, truthful conversation.
From being an immigrant, bullied on the school playground to becoming a multi-millionaire entrepreneur, author and one of the UK’s most recognised fitness trainers. Krissy shared the highs, but also the lows of being an entrepreneur that most won’t speak about.
She's now the CEO of a business valued at almost £100m. This is the raw, unfiltered truth of Krissy Cela.

      <title>E51: The Certainty Of Unexpected Chaos</title>
      <description>This week's episode of The Diary of a CEO is all about the certainty of unexpected chaos. This is a different episode, for the very different times that we’re living in. But, I think you ALL need to hear this, because I did. I discuss why you should be responsible for your actions, how to be positive amongst all the chaos, stay psychologically effective and the importance of being compassionate with your thoughts. I also delve into what I call "happiness dividends" and discuss why it is vital not give up on your long term goals for short term pleasures, especially in this time of uncertainty.

      <title>E50: Jake Humphrey - My Grandma's Suicide Saved Me</title>
      <description>In my most recent episode of The Diary of a CEO, I sat down with the incredibly successful TV presenter, journalist and entrepreneur Jake Humphrey. Jake has gone from being an unqualified drop out, who was fired from McDonalds after just two months for a lack of communication skills to one of the UK’s most well known TV presenters, with accolades such as CBBC, BT Sport, Formula One and much more. Jake also co-founded the production company Whisper Films, alongside former BBC Sport producer Sunil Patel and David Coulthard and the business has grown from £1.5m to almost £20m. Our conversation was extremely honest and open. Jake has struggled to come to terms with the common misconceptions of who he is, battling suicidal thoughts and developing an unhealthy relationship with social media. We discuss the best way to move forward with the devastating impact social media can have and why failure is the key to being successful.
