      <description><![CDATA[<p>Josh Mankiewicz and Keith Morrison sit down to talk about Keith’s episode, “The Woman with No Name”. In 2006, two men out target shooting discovered the body of a woman in the woods of Kilgore, Texas. She had been murdered and her body had been set on fire. She had no ID and, despite their efforts, investigators were unable to identify her.  The case caught the eye of internet sleuths drawn to the unidentified woman in the lavender shirt who still had some of her baby teeth. She became known as “Lavender Doe”.  Members of an organization called the “DNA Doe Project” took up the cause and offered their help. Using genetic genealogy, they worked tirelessly to track down Lavender Doe’s family and give her back her name – Dana Lynn Dodd. Josh and Keith discuss the dedicated work of the DNA Doe Project and chat about the impact their fathers have had on their lives. Also, Dateline digital producer Veronica Mazaika shares details on some unsolved Doe cases Dateline has covered in our Cold Case Spotlight series.

      <itunes:subtitle>Josh Mankiewicz and Keith Morrison sit down to talk about Keith’s episode, “The Woman with No Name”. In 2006, two men out target shooting discovered the body of a woman in the woods of Kilgore, Texas. She had been murdered and her body had been set on fire. She had no ID and, despite their efforts, investigators were unable to identify her.  The case caught the eye of internet sleuths drawn to the unidentified woman in the lavender shirt who still had some of her baby teeth. She became known as “Lavender Doe”.  Members of an organization called the “DNA Doe Project” took up the cause and offered their help. Using genetic genealogy, they worked tirelessly to track down Lavender Doe’s family and give her back her name – Dana Lynn Dodd. Josh and Keith discuss the dedicated work of the DNA Doe Project and chat about the impact their fathers have had on their lives. Also, Dateline digital producer Veronica Mazaika shares details on some unsolved Doe cases Dateline has covered in our Cold Case Spotlight series.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Keith Morrison and Andrea Canning sit down to talk about Keith’s episode, “Menendez Brothers: Chance at Freedom.” Thirty-five years ago, Jose and Kitty Menendez were gunned down in the den of their Beverly Hills home. Their sons, Lyle and Erik, were charged with their murders. A media frenzy surrounded the trial which was televised and captured the nation’s attention. Following each of their juries being unable to come to an agreement, the brothers were convicted in a second trial and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The case is back in the news and capturing the attention of a new audience on social media. And now, the outgoing Los Angeles County D.A. has recommended the brothers be resentenced, which – if a judge agrees – would immediately make them eligible for parole. Keith and Andrea discuss public opinion surrounding the case and details that could be considered in a possible resentencing. Plus, they answer viewer and listener questions about the episode.</p><p>Listen to the full episode of “The Menendez Brothers: Chance at Freedom” on Apple: <a href="https://apple.co/3VBytrd">https://apple.co/3VBytrd</a></p><p>Listen to the full episode on Spotify: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0W8ufgVwDGafjZKrtYhUzh">https://open.spotify.com/episode/0W8ufgVwDGafjZKrtYhUzh</a></p>

      <itunes:subtitle>Blayne Alexander and Keith Morrison sit down to discuss his episode, “After the Halloween Party.”  Friends and family were at a loss when Karen Swift, a Tennessee mother of four, went missing on October 29th, 2011. It took investigators 6 weeks to find Karen’s body and prosecutors 11 years to charge someone with her murder, but the case is anything but closed. Keith and Blayne talk about the small-town gossip that plagued the investigation in Dyersburg, Tennessee, and the private investigator from out of town who set out to solve the case herself. Then, Keith shares a podcast-exclusive clip from an interview with two of Karen’s neighbors who knew her as a child, and Dateline associate producer Sam Springer joins Blayne to answer viewer and listener questions from social media.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Blayne Alexander and Andrea Canning discuss Andrea’s episode, “The Night of the Nor’easter.”  In 2022, Karen Read was charged with killing her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O’Keefe, by drunkenly backing her car into him in blizzard conditions.

Andrea talks about covering Read’s high-profile trial this summer, and what it was like interviewing Read’s defense attorney, Alan Jackson. Later, Andrea shares a podcast-exclusive clip from her conversation with one of John O’Keefe’s family members.

Soon after, the local sheriff launched an investigation into possible abuse, and the school closed. Surprisingly, the person who posted the video was none other than Amanda Householder, the daughter of the school's owners. Keith and Liz discuss Amanda’s choice to go against her parents and how she joined forces with former Circle of Hope students to change Missouri laws regulating religious schools.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Andrea Canning talks to Blayne Alexander about her most recent episode, “Justice for Joy.” In 1991, Joy Hibbs was stabbed, strangled, and her Pennsylvania home was set on fire to cover up the brutal crime. The investigation went cold until a detective with the Bristol Township Police Department picked up the case file decades later and uncovered a connection between the department and a man who’d been interviewed at the time of Joy’s murder. Blayne tells Andrea about the Hibbs family’s desperate search for answers and plays a podcast-exclusive clip from her interview with the woman who finally unlocked the mystery. Blayne and Andrea also discuss how motherhood has affected their approach to interviews.

      <itunes:summary>Andrea Canning talks to Blayne Alexander about her most recent episode, “Justice for Joy.” In 1991, Joy Hibbs was stabbed, strangled, and her Pennsylvania home was set on fire to cover up the brutal crime. The investigation went cold until a detective with the Bristol Township Police Department picked up the case file decades later and uncovered a connection between the department and a man who’d been interviewed at the time of Joy’s murder. Blayne tells Andrea about the Hibbs family’s desperate search for answers and plays a podcast-exclusive clip from her interview with the woman who finally unlocked the mystery. Blayne and Andrea also discuss how motherhood has affected their approach to interviews. Blayne and Dateline producer Justin Balding answer viewer and listener questions about the episode.
