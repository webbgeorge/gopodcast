      <title>Trump Heals Grieving Nation</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Finally, a president willing to blame a devastating air crash on diversity hiring and two of his predecessors! Nearly two weeks into his second term, Trump continues to sow bitterness, fear, and chaos everywhere he turns: issuing a spending freeze so drastic and haphazard that his team has to rescind it after three days, demanding that more than two million federal workers resign or face loyalty tests, and vowing to send 30,000 immigrants to Guantanamo Bay. Meanwhile, three of his most extreme cabinet picks face tough questions in their confirmation hearings—but will it matter? Jon and Dan reflect on a dismal week, what's next, and signs of life in the opposition party. Then, Jon checks in with Senator Chris Murphy about the threats that Democratic leaders are getting, and why it's so important to fight back anyway.</p><p> </p><p>For a closed-captioned version of this episode, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dGYB2IGLpI">click here</a>.

      <itunes:summary>Kamala Harris fulfills her oath of office, certifying the election results on the four-year anniversary of the January 6th Capitol riot. Meanwhile, Republicans strategize about passing Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” jammed full of MAGA hopes and dreams. Jon, Lovett, and Tommy discuss why simply remembering January 6th isn’t enough, and how Democrats should respond to Republicans’ tax cutting agenda. Plus, MAGA-world did what all of us do over the holidays: squabble with our relatives — this time over immigration policy and H-1B visas. Finally, Joe Biden awards the Presidential Medal of Freedom… and the guys don’t get one.</itunes:summary>

      <title>The Old Man and the Clemency</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>President Biden pardons his son Hunter—a move he'd once promised not to make—and the backlash is immediate. Republicans are calling it a political favor, while some Democrats argue it undermines trust in the justice system. Meanwhile, Trump promises to replace FBI Director Christopher Wray with Kash Patel, a loyalist known for wanting to prosecute Trump's enemies (including journalists), even as his pick for Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, faces new allegations of workplace misconduct—and a scathing email from his own mother.

      <title>Kamala’s Closing Argument (feat. AOC)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Kamala Harris delivers a rousing closing speech, promising to be a president for all Americans and sharply contrasting her plans with Donald Trump's. Trump works to clean up that terrible Puerto Rico joke, getting assists from Sean Hannity and, unfortunately, President Biden, and Trump and surrogates like Elon Musk and Mike Johnson remind voters about their plans to take away health care and slash government budgets—and maybe crash the economy while they're at it. Jon Lovett and the Bulwark's Tim Miller sift through all of it, including the three remaining groups of undecided voters and the unending debate over invoking "fascism." Then, Lovett and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talk about how to persuade disaffected progressives and what she's been seeing on the ground in Pennsylvania.</p><p> </p><p>For a closed-captioned version of this episode, click <a href="https://youtu.be/kZGYj1eIp4M">here</a>.

Mark Robinson&apos;s, um, online interests. Then, Tommy, Jon, and Dan debrief Lovett on his (spoiler alert!) brief but iconic run on “Survivor.”</itunes:subtitle>

Plus, Tim Walz talks tacos, and RFK Jr. might be looking for an exit strategy.</p><p> </p><p>For a closed-captioned version of this episode, click <a href="https://youtu.be/sCKK7aW74Fo">here</a>.

Plus, Biden is getting advice from progressives about how to campaign on the economy and the New York Times says Trump may be more resilient than other Republicans when it comes to messaging on abortion. Finally, John Della Volpe, pollster and author of "Fight: How Gen Z is Channeling Their Fear and Passion to Save America," joins to talk about the President's struggle with younger voters.</p><p> </p><p>For a closed-captioned version of this episode, click <a href="https://youtu.be/-Uo222_dXK4">here</a>.

      <title>Introducing: Mother Country Radicals</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Zayd Dohrn was born - underground - his parents were radicals and counter-culture outlaws, on the run from the FBI. Now, Zayd takes us back to the 1970s, when his parents and their young friends in the Weather Underground Organization declared war on the United States government. They brawled with riot cops on the streets of Chicago, bombed the Pentagon and the U.S Capitol, broke comrades out of prison, and teamed up with Black militant groups to rob banks, fight racism - and help build a revolution.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In episode four of this five-part series on the Iowa caucuses, we take you behind the scenes as the campaigns prepare for one of the biggest nights of the primary season, the Liberty and Justice Dinner. Obama’s speech at the event back in 2007 gave his candidacy an enormous boost, but we’ll explain why the evening is as much about what you say as how well you’ve organized. Then we’ll consider proposals to change the primary process that would reduce Iowa’s influence as we continue to wrestle with the question: is this really the best way to pick a president? This series is hosted by Tommy Vietor and produced by Pineapple Street Studios.</p><p> </p><p></p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In episode three of this five-part miniseries on the Iowa caucuses, we dive into the all-important race to lock down the state’s key endorsements.

We’ll also dig into all the criticisms of the Iowa caucuses, from the demographics of the state to the charge that the caucuses themselves are undemocratic. Plus: a ukulele.
